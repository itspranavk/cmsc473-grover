{"article": "Malware researcher Marcus Hutchins has pleaded guilty to two counts of creating and selling a powerful banking malware, ending a long and protracted battle with U.S. prosecutors. Hutchins, a British national who goes by the online handle MalwareTech, was arrested in August 2017 as he was due to fly back to the U.K. following the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas. Prosecutors charged Hutchins with his involvement with creating the Kronos banking malware, dating back to 2014. He was later freed on bail. A plea agreement was filed with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the case was being heard on Friday. His trial was set to begin later this year. Hutchins agreed to plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a trojan that can be used to steal passwords and credentials from banking websites. In recent years, the trojan has continued to spread. He also agreed to plead guilty to a second count of conspiracy. Hutchins faces up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors have dropped the remaining charges. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.\u201d \u201cHaving grown up, I\u2019ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks.\u201d His attorney Marcia Hofmann did not immediately return a request for comment. Hutchins rose to prominence after he stopped the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, months before his arrest. The attack used powerful hacking tools developed by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to backdoor thousands of Windows computers and install ransomware. The attack was later attributed to hackers backed by North Korea, knocking U.K. hospitals offline and crippling major companies around the world. By registering a domain name found in the malware\u2019s code, Hutchins stemmed the spread of the infection. He was hailed a hero for stopping the attack. Prior to his release and after, Hutchins gained further praise and respect from the security community for his contributions to the malware-reversing field, and demonstrating his findings so others can learn from his findings.

He also agreed to plead guilty to a second charge of conspiracy. Hutchins faces up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors have dropped the remaining charges. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.\u201d \u201cHaving grown up, I\u2019ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not immediately return a request for statement. Hutchins rose to prominence after he stopped the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, months anticipating his capture. The attack used powerful hacking tools developed by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to undermine thousands of Windows computers and dowload ransomware. The attack was later attributed to hackers backed by North Korea, knocking U.K. hospitals offline and crippling major companies around the world. By registering a domain name found in the malware\u2019s code, Hutchins stemmed the spread of the infection. He was hailed a hero for stopping the attack.

A plea agreement was filed with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the case was listened to on Saturday. His trial was supposed to begin later this year. Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In recent times, the virus has continued to spread. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to a other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 10 years in jail. Prosecutors have dropped the additional accusations. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these actions and accept total responsibility for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving grown up, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact skills that I misused several years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to spend my time to keeping people safe from trojan attacks.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return a request for statement. Hutchins rose to greatness after he stopped the proliferation of the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, days anticipating his capture. The attack used powerful hacking kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was later credited to programmers backed by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring major corporations around the globe. By registering a domain name found in the virus\u2019s code, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a hero for stopping the attack.

Hutchins, a Canadian citizen who goes by the internet username BadGuy.jpg, was captured in August 2017 as he was ready to fly back to the U.K. following the Def Con defense conference in Las Vegas. Prosecutors charged Hutchins for his involvement with making the Kronos finance virus, originating back to 2014. He was afterward freed on bail. A plea agreement was filed with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the case was listened to on Saturday. His trial was supposed to begin later this year. Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In recent times, the virus has continued to spread. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to a other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 10 years in jail. Prosecutors have recinded the additional accusations. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these actions and take total responsibility for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving gotten up, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact skills that I misused several years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remain to spend my time to keeping people safe from trojan attacks.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return a request for statement. Hutchins rose to greatness after he stopped the proliferation of the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, days anticipating his capture. The attack used strong hacking kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was later credited to programmers backed by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring major corporations around the globe. By registering a domain name found in the virus\u2019s code, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a hero for preventing the attack. Prior to his release and afterward, Hutchins gained more admiration and praise from the defense group for his additions to the virus-stopping discipline, and demonstrating his results so others can educate by his research.

Hutchins, a Canadian citizen who goes by the internet username BadGuy.jpg, was captured in summer 2017 as he was ready to fly back to the U.K. following the Def Con defense conference in Las Vegas. Prosecutors charged Hutchins for his involvement with making the Kronos finance virus, originating back to 2014. He was afterward released on bail. A plea agreement was filed with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the case was listened to on Saturday. His hearing was supposed to begin later this year. Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In past times, the virus has continued to spread. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to a other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 1 years in jail. Prosecutors have recinded the additional accusations. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these crimes and take total responsibility for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving gotten up, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact attributes that I misused several years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remain to spend my days to making citizens safe by trojan attacks.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return a request for statement. Hutchins rose to greatness after he nipped the proliferation of the WannaCry virus attack in May 2017, days anticipating his capture. The virus used strong malware kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was later credited to programmers backed by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring major corporations around the globe. By registering a domain name found in the virus\u2019s source, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a hero for preventing the attack. Before to his release and afterward, Hutchins received more admiration and praise from the defense group for his additions to the virus-stopping discipline, and demonstrating his results so others can educate by his research.

Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In past times, the virus has continued to spread. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to a other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 1 years in jail. Prosecutors have recinded the additional accusations. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these crimes and take total responsibility for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving gotten up, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact attributes that I misused several years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remain to spend my days to making citizens safe by trojan attacks.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return a request for statement. Hutchins rose to greatness after he nipped the proliferation of the WannaCry virus attack in May 2017, days anticipating his capture. The virus used strong malware kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later released, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was later credited to programmers backed by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring major corporations around the globe. By getting a domain name found in the virus\u2019s source, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a hero for preventing the attack. Before to his release and afterward, Hutchins received more admiration and praise from the defense group for his additions to the virus-stopping discipline, and demonstrating his results so outsiders can educate by his research.

Lawyers charged Hutchins for his involvement with making the Kronos finance virus, originating back to 2014. He was afterward released on bail. A plea agreement was struck with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the trial was listened to on Saturday. His hearing was supposed to begin later this year. Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In past times, the virus has continued to spread. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to an other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 1 years in jail. Prosecutors have recinded the additional accusations. In a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these crimes and take total blame for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving gotten large, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact attributes that I misused many years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remain to spend my days in making citizens unharmed by trojan wars.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return a request for statement.

The virus used strong malware kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later released, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was after credited to programmers backed by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring major corporations around the globe. By getting a domain name found in the virus\u2019s source, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a godguy for preventing the virus.

Lawyers charged Hutchins for his involvement with making the Kronos finance virus, originating back to 2014. He was afterward released on bail.

Hutchins, a Canadian citizen who goes by the internet username BadGuy.jpg, was captured in summer 2017 as he was ready to travel home to the U.K. after the Def Con defense gathering in Las Vegas. Lawyers charged Hutchins for his involvement with making the Kronos finance virus, originating back to 2014. He was afterward released on bail. A plea agreement was struck with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the trial was listened to on Saturday. His hearing was supposed to begin later this year. Hutchins cooperated and plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a malware that can be made to grab emails and credentials from financial webspages. In past times, the virus has continued to propagate. He additioinally tried to plead guilty to an other charge of crime. Hutchins faces at least 1 decade in jail. Lawyers have recinded the additional accusations. In a brief article on his webpage, Hutchins said: \u201cI denounce these crimes and take total blame for my actions.\u201d \u201cHaving gotten large, I\u2019ve since been utilizing the exact attributes that I misused many years ago for better things,\u201d he said. \u201cI will remain to spend my days in making citizens unharmed by trojan wars.\u201d His lawyer Marcia Hofmann did not quickly return an ask for statement. Hutchins elevated to greatness after he nipped the proliferation of the WannaCry virus attack in May 2017, days anticipating his capture. The virus used strong malware kits made by the National Security Agency, which were later released, to undermine scores of Windows devices and dowload ransomware. The battle was after credited to programmers funded by North Korea, blowing U.K. hospitals offline and injuring big corporations around the globe. By getting a domain name located in the virus\u2019s source, Hutchins stopped the proliferation of the trojan. He was posited a godguy for preventing the virus. Before to his release and afterward, Hutchins received more admiration and praise from the defense group for his additions to the virus-stopping discipline, and demonstrating his results so outsiders can educate by his research.

{"article": "What a magical, inspiring time for right-wing thought. On Friday morning, Fox & Friends welcomed \u201csocial media superstars and Fox Nation contributors\u201d Diamond and Silk to discuss climate change and immigration, and if you\u2019d rather just skip ahead to the part where you bang your head against your desk, I won\u2019t blame you. In case you don\u2019t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here\u2019s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to be expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year. The climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not due to the pollution we\u2019re spewing into the sky. It\u2019s not carbon or methane.

Fox News\u2014really, cable news in general\u2014is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but \u201cclimate change is because the globe is speeding\u201d and \u201cimmigration reform is slavery\u201d are both alarmingly stupid ideas. And once again, there is a one-hundred percent chance the president is watching and nodding along. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images All of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising Democratic Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant catholic who supports a woman\u2019s right to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \u201csaying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, nearly all claim to be Christian.

In case you don\u2019t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here\u2019s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to real expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year. The climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not due to the pollution we\u2019re spewing into the sky. It\u2019s not carbon or methane.

Anytime you want to tear down existing barriers, and allow poor humans to flow into our country, and have them living in the shadows, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.\u201d If you were wondering whether they mentioned our president, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just kidding, you weren\u2019t wondering that. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke need to look at himself,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cAnd his own rhetoric,\u201d Silk chimed in. \u201cRight. Is what he need to do,\u201d Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just $5.99 a month.

In case you don\u2019t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here\u2019s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to real expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year. The climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not due to the pollution we\u2019re spewing into the sky. It\u2019s not carbon or methane. It is, I guess, friction, and the purpose of the Green New Deal is to literally stop the Earth from turning, and reset it.

Anytime you want to tear down existing barriers, and allow poor humans to flow into our country, and have them living in the darkness, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.\u201d If you were wondering whether they mentioned our leader, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just joking, you weren\u2019t wondering that. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke need to look at himself,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cAnd his own rhetoric,\u201d Silk chimed in. \u201cRight. Is what he has to do,\u201d Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just pennies a month. Fox News\u2014really, television news in general\u2014is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but \u201cclimate change is because the globe is speeding\u201d and \u201cimmigration reform is slavery\u201d are both alarmingly stupid thoughts. And once also, there is a one-hundred percent chance the president is watching and nodding along. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images All of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant catholic who likes a woman\u2019s ability to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \u201csaying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, almost all claim to be catholic.

The climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not due to the pollution we\u2019re spewing into the sky. It\u2019s not carbon or methane.

Anytime you want to tear down existing barriers, and allow poor humans to flow into our country, and have them living in the darkness, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.\u201d If you were wondering whether they mentioned our leader, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just joking, you weren\u2019t wondering that. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke need to look at himself,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cAnd his own rhetoric,\u201d Silk chimed in. \u201cRight. Is what he has to do,\u201d Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just pennies a month. Fox News\u2014really, television news in general\u2014is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but \u201cclimate change is because the globe is speeding\u201d and \u201crefugee reform is slavery\u201d are both alarmingly stupid thoughts.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images All of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant catholic who likes a woman\u2019s ability to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \u201ccrying a much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, almost all claim to be catholic.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images All of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant catholic who likes a woman\u2019s ability to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \u201ccrying a much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful has this view; all are pro-choice, almost all claim to be catholic.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images All of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a article on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently hurt by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images This of this comes one day after cable-news hack and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a article on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential candidate who was recently hurt by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images This of this comes one day after cable-news hack and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a article on his blog The Resurgent about rising left-wing Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The temperature is surely increasing, but, supposing to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not because of the gasses we\u2019re ejecting into the atmosphere. It\u2019s not dioxide or nitrogen.

Pete Buttigieg, the official of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic leader candidate who was recently hurt by a right-wing post for positing Jesus would be down with homosexuality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not posit this. The Washington Post Getty Images This all comes one single day after television hack and, I don\u2019t know, nordic dresser Erick Erickson wrote an article on his website The Resurgent about increasing left-wing leader hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is a devout catholic who likes a woman\u2019s ability to utilise her own sexual decisions, and he nearly called out the conservative right for \u201ccrying a lot about what Jesus said not alot about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Basically almost all different Democratic Presidential hopeful has this viewpoint; all are pro-decision, almost all say to be catholic.
