{"title": "Premier Horgan pledges province's capital plan to help boost value-added timber manufacturing", "text": "Premier John Horgan promised that the province will build a major modernization of the Royal B.C. Aqueduct.\nThe new manufacturing process will allow scientists to build more efficient, environmentally friendly processes with natural materials and techniques they already use to create many types of materials and products.\n\u201cI\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing what the community thinks about this,\u201d said Horgan, speaking from Richmond. That\u2019s why we have a new building next to the first-floor lobby. The new investment will be worth about $9.3-million.\nWe have seen government leaders promise to work towards renewable energy sources and create \u201cjob-creating technology\u201d\u2014from electric-reinforcing machinery to wind turbines to bioenergy to wind machines\u2014and they are doing so in a world where the biggest polluters in the country\u2014coal, oil and gas\u2014believe such \u201cjobs\u201d will grow. NDP is in favour of a single-payer healthcare system with paid for through taxation, says Health Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould on April 13, 2015. Singaporean Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already raised concerns about the Malaysian Government\u2019s intention to delay the construction of an airport by 4 December, when Malaysia plans a major overhaul of the country\u2019s already outdated three-nation \u201cTrans-Malaysia\u201d railway network over which the Kuala Lumpur-Cambodia Highway will link a three-pronged rail line - an airport, an airport to be named for Sir Richard Branson, and also for Malaysia\u2019s aviation industry, sources have said.\nIt would be a big boon for that American industry, which is the single largest employer for U.S. workers in the world today.\nAs he toured the country to discuss the development, he introduced the proposal to representatives from the International Lumber Association and from several of the steel industry associations who represented U.S. and Canada members of NAFTA.\nHe warned it was time to change all this, warning that the sector was \u201ca new threat to our people\u201d. But, she said, changing priorities is not always easy, especially \u201cwhen you think of growth in a very expensive way,\u201d Horgan said. While I was browsing a large, book-laden newspaper last week, I noticed that I couldn\u2019t see the original image of the image above the line.\nAs we get deeper in debt with Treasury, and that means an attempt to look ahead in terms of how we\u2019ve dealt with the future of the banks, we become more likely to see a return on capital that reflects the willingness of the banks to borrow in order to make its payments.\u201c Horgan said the government has already begun to formulate policies that, once put into effect, will improve living standards for First Nations in a way that will benefit others and help the environment. \u2021\n\nA report by B.C.\nFacing environmental challenges from mining, oil and gas drilling and forest fire, B.C. It is more about making sure the public is in the dark as to how their vote matters.\u201c\nAnd while that was still not happening, the same idea worked. The letter said in part that the U.B.C.N.\n\u201cThe TSA has a great track record of delivering on its priorities, and we look forward to seeing where this process takes us ... for our country,\u201d the TSA Administrator said.\nThere is competition and economic necessity to expand the commercial timber market in Vancouver, according to Dufner, however the federal government is slow to address it.\n\u201cTo grow and to get more people and not only to make sure that we continue to expand our product portfolio and make more money.\nWhile the two organizations will hold several public sessions before deciding if their efforts are appropriate, their efforts should ultimately be considered.\u202b\u201cThe organization is hopeful that other states may benefit from the public involvement of this local organization and the opportunity to address the issues before it affects local timber products,\u201d said Steve Shumaker, president of the Seattle State Timber Association. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work with [White House Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke] on a partnership,\u201d he added.\nYou will simply fail, because you can understand the whole meaning of a sentence. Premier\u2019s representative, said there is no doubt that the proposed changes were rushed ahead; it\u2019s been a long process to make a change to the province\u2019s current plan or to allow new ones to come online.\n\u200b\u201cIt seems to me that there\u2019s a lack of transparency being done in the environment ministry to say if the minister is making the investments he wants or not, what\u2019s their policy to make available when they need to,\u201d Mr Hunt said.

This is uncle-ing.\nAnd so, if the couple is sitting where you believe you and your brother should be sitting, you say, \u201cHi guys, would you mind moving over two chairs so my brother and I can sit next to our parents?\u201d\nREAD MORE: You're ready for your adult child and his kid to move out. How do you handle? \u00bb\nIn terms of the buffet hoarding (a pet peeve of mine), in our large family we have dealt with this by one or more elders leading a blessing before the serving, acknowledging and publicly thanking the people who prepared the food, and then stating: \u201cLet\u2019s let the older people go through the line first, so they can get themselves situated.

And now I have begun to wonder whether this is her problem, or mine.\nThere is no restriction posted on when a sandwich can be ordered. So what do I do? Say something to her? Say something to the manager?

{"title": "Brexit: Corbyn told to back new EU referendum or lose millions of supporters", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has been warned by Labour\u2019s leader in the European parliament and other grandees that the party will be deserted by millions of anti-Brexit voters if it fails to clearly back a second referendum in its manifesto for next month\u2019s EU elections.\nThe message from Richard Corbett, who leads Labour\u2019s 20 MEPs, comes amid growing fears at the top of the party that it could lose a generation of young, pro-EU voters if it does not guarantee another public vote.\nThat age group, as well as many other Remainers, MPs say, could turn instead to unambiguously anti-Brexit parties, including the fledgling independent group Change UK, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the SNP.\nCorbett said: \u201cIf Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message. If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well.\u201d\nRichard Corbett, leader of Labour\u2019s 20 representatives in the European parliament. Photograph: Imageplotter/REX/Shutterstock\nWhile Labour says it is keeping the option of a second referendum on the table in talks with the government, some key figures close to Jeremy Corbyn have been reluctant to confirm that another public vote would be held on any deal that is agreed and approved by parliament. This has prompted speculation that there may be no commitment to one in Labour\u2019s European election manifesto.\nShould Labour support a second Brexit referendum? | Jess Phillips and Gloria de Piero Read more\nFormer Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett also called for the manifesto to back a second public vote, saying: \u201cIt is very important that there is a clear message about where Labour stands and what Labour is offering. In my view that clear and simple message should be that there should be a confirmatory vote of the British people.\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity for Labour if we are clear. But lack of clarity would cost us support not only in these elections but it will feed through into the next general election and that may not be far away.\u201d\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn\u2019s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be \u201can NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders\u201d. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\nOne senior party figure said: \u201cThe result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.\u201d\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson\u2019s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.\u201d\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement.

Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975.

But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be.

Wilson\u2019s example is a good one.

He said: \u201cMost Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s recent comments about a customs union \u2013 that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cIf this is indeed the case, then it\u2019s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum.

He pointed to evidence that the EU has done more to boost its membership than it has done to reduce it, such as the \u201cexpanded social mobility\u201d system and \u201copen-border\u201d treaties of the European Council and the European Parliament.\nThe only way to find where this is possible is to drive through a series of more than one lane or route in advance through a large and busy road network that is often well-stocked with traffic and parking lots. \u201cWe will continue to debate over any change of government if there is an independent referendum on the matter,\u201d said one person close to the Corbyn camp.\nThere have so far remained unanswered questions surrounding which candidates are supported here in Poland, and what their support will include when the EU leaves. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said Theresa May should back a second referendum on the issue.\nFormer Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett also called for the manifesto to back a second public vote, saying: \u201cIt is very important that there is a clear message about where Labour stands and what Labour is offering. In my view that clear and simple message should be that there should be a confirmatory vote of the British people.\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity for Labour if we are clear. But lack of clarity would cost us support not only in these elections but it will feed through into the next general election and that may not be far away.\u201d\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn\u2019s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be \u201can NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders\u201d. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\nOne senior party figure said: \u201cThe result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.\u201d\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum.

{"title": "Brexit: Corbyn told to back new EU referendum or lose millions of supporters", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has been warned by Labour\u2019s leader in the European parliament and other grandees that the party will be deserted by millions of anti-Brexit voters if it fails to clearly back a second referendum in its manifesto for next month\u2019s EU elections.\nConservative MP and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Michael Gove, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d when Tory backbencher Stephen Smith said the party was going nowhere.\nCorbett, the first openly gay MP in government as well as minister for European affairs, has spoken about how Ukip can be held back if Ukip is not able to secure support across Europe.\nAfter several days of intensive lobbying by former Remainers, the group has finally moved on. \u201cIt could mean the Conservatives could come out with a pledge that it cannot support a vote that only confirms that the UK is at odds with Europe\u2019s interest in Brexit \u2013 so we need to find a sensible way out of this crisis.\nIn closing Mr Kavanagh was asked if any changes had been made but he replied that the motion \u201cwas an agreement in principle\u201d. He pointed to evidence that the EU has done more to boost its membership than it has done to reduce it, such as the \u201cexpanded social mobility\u201d system and \u201copen-border\u201d treaties of the European Council and the European Parliament.\nThe only way to find where this is possible is to drive through a series of more than one lane or route in advance through a large and busy road network that is often well-stocked with traffic and parking lots. \u201cWe will continue to debate over any change of government if there is an independent referendum on the matter,\u201d said one person close to the Corbyn camp.\nThere have so far remained unanswered questions surrounding which candidates are supported here in Poland, and what their support will include when the EU leaves. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said Theresa May should back a second referendum on the issue.\nInstead, it has turned into another high court case with a more liberal aim \u2013 the one that was ultimately overturned by a decision this week by the Justice and Development (Juicing) Court in London, which could see Theresa May\u2019s ban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d removed from legal guns licences for anyone over 18 years. If there is a second vote they should vote for that; if there is a third vote they should vote for that.\nAs I have said at the beginning of the debate, these are very important issues that we have to consider. We don\u2019t have to win the next election because we have to stop the immigration crisis that we have now.\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn\u2019s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be \u201can NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders\u201d. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\nOne senior party figure said: \u201cThe result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.\u201d\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson\u2019s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.\u201d\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement. He said: \u201cMost Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s recent comments about a customs union \u2013 that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cIf this is indeed the case, then it\u2019s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum.

{"title": "Brexit: Corbyn told to back new EU referendum or lose millions of supporters", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn has been warned by Labour\u2019s leader in the European parliament and other grandees that the party will be deserted by millions of anti-Brexit voters if it fails to clearly back a second referendum in its manifesto for next month\u2019s EU elections.\nConservative MP and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Michael Gove, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d when Tory backbencher Stephen Smith said the party was going nowhere.\nCorbett, the first openly gay MP in government as well as minister for European affairs, has spoken about how Ukip can be held back if Ukip is not able to secure support across Europe.\nAfter several days of intensive lobbying by former Remainers, the group has finally moved on. \u201cIt could mean the Conservatives could come out with a pledge that it cannot support a vote that only confirms that the UK is at odds with Europe\u2019s interest in Brexit \u2013 so we need to find a sensible way out of this crisis.\nIn closing Mr Kavanagh was asked if any changes had been made but he replied that the motion \u201cwas an agreement in principle\u201d. He pointed to evidence that the EU has done more to boost its membership than it has done to reduce it, such as the \u201cexpanded social mobility\u201d system and \u201copen-border\u201d treaties of the European Council and the European Parliament.\nThe only way to find where this is possible is to drive through a series of more than one lane or route in advance through a large and busy road network that is often well-stocked with traffic and parking lots. \u201cWe will continue to debate over any change of government if there is an independent referendum on the matter,\u201d said one person close to the Corbyn camp.\nThere have so far remained unanswered questions surrounding which candidates are supported here in Poland, and what their support will include when the EU leaves. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said Theresa May should back a second referendum on the issue.\nInstead, it has turned into another high court case with a more liberal aim \u2013 the one that was ultimately overturned by a decision this week by the Justice and Development (Juicing) Court in London, which could see Theresa May\u2019s ban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d removed from legal guns licences for anyone over 18 years. If there is a second vote they should vote for that; if there is a third vote they should vote for that.\nAs I have said at the beginning of the debate, these are very important issues that we have to consider. We don\u2019t have to win the next election because we have to stop the immigration crisis that we have now.\nWhen they go their own way, they can and should run as a progressive movement, as we now know from the political class. Sitting on the conference floor of the chamber after having spent two days discussing Ukip\u2019s European project, Owen made the case that Labour has long been on the brink of abandoning the UK\u2019s role as a \u201cdemocratic broker\u201d for Europe. In the letter, they say that at a time when the Labour leader is under the greatest attack he has had at any stage since the crash he will commit to using his majority in the NEC as his \u201csolution\u201d even though no clear choice is available. The first NEC decision was that a committee should take up the matter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high level,\u201d says the Labour foreign secretary, John Reid. So, if the shadow cabinet does not approve, where does the cabinet meeting go?\nIf Labour are unable to win back support from its leftwing base the referendum could be the first vote since the Conservatives came to power back on 2 May to back a second independence referendum for the British people. Among those who think the UK could be better off without free movement of workers, 43% support Labour and 38% would back Conservative. The results also show that a significant number of Scots would be more than happy with the UK Independence Party.\nThe EU\u2019s decision to remain in the EU could trigger another government run by an independent party in the second term.\nThe Conservative MP for London South said he would accept a first choice vote - meaning the party would run a single vote if it were in majority. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: \u201cI wonder what she said when it comes to Corbyn\u2019s \u2019leave\u2019 movement.\u201d\nOne of the people, named Bill Hicks, was a fellow employee of the Trump Organization.\nOur politicians, we are convinced that we are still the most effective coalition government in the history of Britain.\u2021 \u201cThat is what we believe about the role it will have on the future of our country. While many Tories had long been at loggerheads over EU membership, others had begun to question the EU\u2019s membership status.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he says.\nThe former First Minister said Labour was right to say what it deemed to be the left-wing policy of the Conservatives. As long as that happens - as long as the Government gets out of government, and whatever it finds itself out and says it\u2019s a better proposition - there\u2019s no doubt of that.
