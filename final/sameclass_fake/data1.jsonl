In a statement on Saturday, Horgan announced that his government will introduce legislation this year to ensure the province\u2019s planned project to put construction value-added timber on the table for B.C.\u2019s 35,000 Indigenous people will be done in Victoria. The minister responsible for Crown corporations told Postmedia on Friday that it will be a challenge to ensure the proposed value-added timber project \u2014 and other units \u2014 will be built in Ontario or Quebec, or elsewhere in Canada. According to Horgan, another challenge is that the province will not be able to see the prices paid for these forests and therefore can\u2019t sell the wood to other buyers in the Okanagan. \u201cSo we have to make sure that B.C. does not see the value-added wood being done in Ontario or Quebec,\u201d said Horgan, who did not say how much the province will contribute to the funding. The New Democrats\u2019 $300-million investment in B.C.\u2019s timber industry will be part of B.C.\u2019s Project WA Impact, which was unveiled last October. It will go towards rebuilding barriers for Indigenous people, encouraging Indigenous companies to create new businesses and foster a trade and labour relationship with Atlantic Canada. The cabinet is also expected to announce $30 million in matching funds for Indigenous municipalities. \u201cI need to say that this is a new investment that is welcome news,\u201d said Dr. Tony Grossi, B.C.\u2019s director of Economic and Agricultural Development. Grossi told Postmedia on Saturday that the 10,000 jobs in the value-added forestry sector predicted in B.C. is being hit especially hard by the labour crisis. \u201cFor the rest of the province, it\u2019s going to be awful difficult,\u201d he said, referring to construction workers and ship workers employed in the valley. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for B.C.\u2019s forestry sector to make its case to win trade.\u201d\nThe B.C. Forest Industries Association \u2014 responsible for 90 per cent of B.C.\u2019s world market value-added forestry \u2014 told Postmedia that under the initiative announced Friday, producers will now have a say on the price that is awarded to them for wood. Grossi said for the first time, B.C.\u2019s 50,000 Indigenous people will be able to explore jobs opportunities in those other wood trade regions, since another opportunity they will have is to join up with American workers and work on an investment strategy in Canada to create jobs in forestry. \u201cThis is big, so we want to be part of the solution,\u201d he said. First Nations leaders also welcomed the news, with Carla Bruni-Sinoussi, chief executive of the NFB First Nations Wits Halluw Ha\u2019 in Paynesville, B.C., saying that it\u2019s crucial that residential school survivors be given direct representation in the creation of the new timber policy. She said the experience of working with First Nations does mean that the importance of their inclusion will be respected by all stakeholders. \u201cThe government\u2019s decision \u2026 makes a very big difference, because it will hopefully help to promote our community in the new project,\u201d Bruni-Sinoussi said, noting it also means, for example, that the North Shore Indigenous Shop Assistants are included in the policy.
