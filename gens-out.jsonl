If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well.\u201d\nRichard Corbett, leader of Labour\u2019s 20 representatives in the European parliament. Photograph: Imageplotter\/REX\/Shutterstock\nWhile Labour says it is keeping the option of a second referendum on the table in talks with the government, some key figures close to Jeremy Corbyn have been reluctant to confirm that another public vote would be held on any deal that is agreed and approved by parliament. This has prompted speculation that there may be no commitment to one in Labour\u2019s European election manifesto.\nShould Labour support a second Brexit referendum? | Jess Phillips and Gloria de Piero Read more\nFormer Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett also called for the manifesto to back a second public vote, saying: \u201cIt is very important that there is a clear message about where Labour stands and what Labour is offering. In my view that clear and simple message should be that there should be a confirmatory vote of the British people.\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity for Labour if we are clear. But lack of clarity would cost us support not only in these elections but it will feed through into the next general election and that may not be far away.\u201d\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn\u2019s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be \u201can NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders\u201d. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\nOne senior party figure said: \u201cThe result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.\u201d\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson\u2019s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.\u201d\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement. He said: \u201cMost Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s recent comments about a customs union \u2013 that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cIf this is indeed the case, then it\u2019s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum. The first task should be to get a \u2018Labour-shaped\u2019 deal agreed and embedded in the withdrawal agreement so it was not able to be ripped up by future Tory leader.\n\u201cThere will then of course be ample opportunity for colleagues to press their case for a second referendum on the basis of this renegotiated deal by attaching an amendment to the legislation needed to implement Brexit.\u201d\n","summary":"A generation of young people could desert the party, says Richard Corbett, leader of Labour MEPs", "gens_article": "Jeremy Corbyn has been told he has to \u201creach out\u201d to anti-Europeans if he is to win over a large majority of the electorate in the upcoming snap election.\nA campaign strategy has been launched by the Independent Group of MPs, for which Corbyn has been the only candidate so far, urging voters to consider not backing Brexit.

The killer brought an AR-15 type rifle, a semi-automatic pistol and enough ammunition to do far more harm \u2013 but he was stopped before he could by police. The police were aided by a brave teacher and by a well-practiced school lockdown. After being confronted and exchanging gunfire with police, the killer committed suicide. Police also found the killer had brought a large knife.\nWithin hours, politicians were already attempting to exploit the tragedy \u2013 including Oregon\u2019s U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer and U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, who were calling for expanded background checks.\nMore laws are not the answer\nFurther expanding background checks in Oregon \u2013 already one of the most restrictive states for background checks \u2013 would not have stopped the 15-year-old killer. It\u2019s already illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase a firearm in Oregon, and this killer didn\u2019t buy the guns \u2013 he took them \u2013 by defeating his family\u2019s security measures where the guns were secured.\nAdditionally, the 15-year-old killer at Reynolds brought firearms and a large knife into a high school despite school policies banning weapons, Oregon state law prohibiting bringing or having a weapon at school, and the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act.\nThe killer was also in violation of ORS 166.250 (unlawful possession of firearms) even before he got to the school because he was under 18, and he was in violation of the Multnomah County gun control ordinance passed last year.\nThe 15-year-old killer violated many, many existing weapons-related laws \u2013 and none of those laws stopped him.\nWhat did work?\nReynolds High School has two full-time officers on campus every day \u2013 and they were on the scene in less than a minute \u2013 and they are being credited with stopping the killer before he could inflict more carnage.\nAfter Sandy Hook, the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre advocated for a police officer in every school. He said \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d The media, who widely ridiculed and mocked him at the time, is largely ignoring this important part of the story. It\u2019s important because it actually worked to save lives at Reynolds.\nWhat also worked was the bravery of a Reynolds teacher, who sounded the alert that initiated the school lockdown even though he had been wounded. A lockdown that had recently been practiced. KOIN reported \u201cPolice said the response from school staff, police and students prevented \u2018many, many\u2019 deaths, given the amount of ammunition [the killer] carried. Troutdale Mayor Doug Daoust said Reynolds High had participated in an active shooter drill in the weeks leading up to June 10.\u201d\nWhat more can be done?\nThere needs to be a continued focus on mental health, including increasing funding where it\u2019s needed. More schools should have armed law enforcement present. The media should stop giving publicity to the killers. There needs to be more funding for prosecutors, police and jails so that existing laws can be enforced.\nAdditionally, there needs to be public pressure on the media to stop perpetuating false and highly emotional data and perceptions. For example, all the irresponsible news agencies who reported there have been 74 school shootings since Sandy Hook in Newtown, CT. The 74 number came from Michael Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun group Everytown for Gun Safety. CNN has since taken the time to investigate the number and found the actual number to be 15.\nIt is indicative of how gun control groups are willing to stretch the truth to achieve their agenda. When they do that, and when the media parrots it, it makes rational discussion much more difficult.\nPlease let\u2019s move off of fixed political agendas and focus on what works to keep our children and everyone safer.\nUPDATE (11\/12\/2014): The Oregonian reported that the guns used by Jared Padgett had been locked up: \u201cInvestigators determined that the AR-15 rifle that Padgett used in the school shooting had been locked in a Pelican-brand gun case in the bedroom he shared with his older brother, Lucas Padgett. A .25-caliber handgun found on Jared Padgett after he had killed himself with the rifle the day of the June 10 shooting had been locked in his father Michael Padgett\u2019s bedroom, investigators concluded.\u201d\nTo read more from Dan, visit www.dan-lucas.com\n", "gens_article": "by Donald Renton\nOn Monday June 9th, 14-year-old Andrew Andrews and his friend Braxton Smith died as they were trying to retrieve a gun from a moving vehicle while walking home from Reynolds High School. It was one of a number of tragic shootings at the high school, just days after a school shooting in the Missouri town of Teensville.\nReynolds High had already endured its share of trouble recently. On the day Andrews and Smith were killed, a seventh grader took a gun to school and got into an altercation with a student who confronted him. A week before Andrew and Braxton were killed, a robbery at Reynolds High School, including the murder of an armed security guard, resulted in a $25,000 reward to catch the killer.\nAndrews was a fine student, who loved life. He planned to study engineering, baseball, and martial arts. He always had friends and people with whom he could connect. He always had the ability to \u201cdo things he didn\u2019t know how to do.\u201d\nAndrews did a lot of things. He knew how to build a fist so you could literally stroke it and make it larger so you could fight. He knew how to swim. He\u2019d be a big kid, and he would always come to Reynolds High to help other kids who were just trying to get around, a chance to become what they wanted to be.\nAndrews was a gentle soul, and he died for his desire to build a mighty fist. I know he was right. I spent as much time as I could watching T-ball games in Reynolds, and the high school athletics team traveled to Missouri looking for redemption.\nA black student from Missouri drove his BMW into the front of the school for a prank. The 7-year-old driver tried to block the road and allowed the two students to pass. Andrews and Smith came along, and Andrew shot one of them through the windshield.\nThe police arrived and learned the driver had fired a shot through the driver\u2019s side window before fleeing. The driver then called 911 and the two students who were in the car drove to hospital.\nBraxton Smith died as he tried to get out of the car after being shot. Andrew Andrews was shot a few inches below the corner of his right eye.\nAndrews and Braxton are no hero. Braxton could have received the death penalty if he committed the crime. If the driver had turned on the car\u2019s hazard lights, he would not have gotten out of the car.\nBraxton may have been shot by one of the students who killed him, but Andrew was a terrible gun thief. He took out a handgun and an AR-15 in Reynolds High. He had concealed carry permits from a number of states, some of which he continued to carry at Reynolds High. The insurance company that offered him a place to work insured him for $500,000. He hired someone who worked for him.\nThe law states that when someone steals or steals from a handgun, it is \u201cimmediately removed from the premises.\u201d In many states where guns have to be carried at the convenience of one\u2019s residence, Indiana law says that, in other words, if someone steals a handgun or an AR-15 at home, they must be compensated by the home. If someone enters your home with a gun and takes it away without firing a shot, that person is guilty of a felony.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"title": "Premier Horgan pledges province's capital plan to help boost value-added timber manufacturing", "text": "Premier John Horgan promised that the province will build a major modernization of the Royal B.C. Museum using mass-timber components as a first step to kickstart demand for made-in-B.C., value added products.\nHorgan, speaking at the Council of Forest Industries convention in Vancouver on Friday, offered the measure as an incentive for the industry\u2019s co-operation in a process to revitalize the province\u2019s Interior forest sector, which is grappling with the challenge of shrinking timber supplies due to wildfires and the mountain pine beetle infestation.\nAnd it won\u2019t just be the museum revitalization. Horgan said a new $1.9-billion St. Paul\u2019s Hospital will use timber wherever it can. As for his government\u2019s $20-billion capital plan, \u201cto the greatest extent possible, mass timber will be the foundation of that construction.\u201d\n\u201cAnnouncing that the Royal B.C. Museum upgrade will be done with mass timber is transformative for the institution and also for the sector,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cSimilarly, St. Paul\u2019s and other projects will create a domestic market, and from there, we can start to market to other jurisdictions.\u201d\nHorgan talked about the concept as an election promise in 2017, but held it out Friday as an opportunity to an audience of some 650 industry representatives as he sought buy-in for a process to speed along a transformation of the industry from high-volume lumber production to high-value manufacturing.\nHowever, the industry is in the middle of shedding jobs by closing mills or reducing shifts to cope with those shrinking timber supplies at the same time as Horgan\u2019s government is trying to create jobs in forestry.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a transformation away from the high-volume to the high-value economy, we\u2019re going to be struggling,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cAnd this is not a surprise to anyone, nor did it just arrive on my watch. But as we deal with that downturn, we need to also deal with the approach.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where I\u2019m asking the industry to be innovative,\u201d Horgan said, calling for companies, First Nations, community leaders and unions to take part in consultation talks. The process won\u2019t replace existing consultations with First Nations or timber-allocation discussion, Horgan said. The idea is for people in B.C.\u2019s Interior to come up with a common vision for revitalizing forestry.\n\u201cIf I announce, as often happens at these COFI conventions, \u2018This is the government\u2019s view,\u2019 there would be 100 people calling in to question the value of those incentives or restrictions,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cIf I ask the people that are dependent on the industry to sit down and come up with a common position, we\u2019re going to get better outcomes.\u201d\nHorgan sent a letter, dated April 1, to industry executives, First Nations, community and labour leaders looking for their participation in the engagement process. Instead of a top-down prescription, Horgan said government is looking for, and will support, development of an \u201cinclusive, implementable TSA-level vision for industry competitiveness and community economic stability.\u201d\nThe industry welcomed Horgan\u2019s pledge to use mass timber in public projects to help create a bigger domestic market in B.C.\u2019s export-dependent forestry sector.\n\u201cWhat the premier talked about today, what we\u2019ve talked a lot about, is the best way to approach helping our industry is to grow demand,\u201d COFI CEO Susan Yurkovich said.\nHowever, Yurkovich said industry representatives are still figuring out Horgan\u2019s offer to take part in the engagement process for revitalizing the Interior\u2019s forest industry.\n\u201cI understand there is a desire to have a process to address challenges in the Interior and do that collectively, and of course I\u2019m supportive of that,\u201d Yurkovich said. \u201c(But) I don\u2019t fully understand the process.\u201d\nJohn Rustad, the MLA for Nechako Lakes and the B.C. Liberal party\u2019s forestry critic, said industry representatives are telling him that government is creating uncertainty that has them holding back on investments in what has become a high-cost place to do business.\n\u201cGovernment needs to start looking at the challenges that industry has and have its initiatives in that context,\u201d said Rustad, who was in attendance at the convention. \u201cHow do we make the industry more competitive?\u201d\ndepenner@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/derrickpenner\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

Forest Industries Association \u2014 responsible for 90 per cent of B.C.\u2019s world market value-added forestry \u2014 told Postmedia that under the initiative announced Friday, producers will now have a say on the price that is awarded to them for wood.\nGrossi said for the first time, B.C.\u2019s 50,000 Indigenous people will be able to explore jobs opportunities in those other wood trade regions, since another opportunity they will have is to join up with American workers and work on an investment strategy in Canada to create jobs in forestry.\n\u201cThis is big, so we want to be part of the solution,\u201d he said.\nFirst Nations leaders also welcomed the news, with Carla Bruni-Sinoussi, chief executive of the NFB First Nations Wits Halluw Ha\u2019 in Paynesville, B.C., saying that it\u2019s crucial that residential school survivors be given direct representation in the creation of the new timber policy.\nShe said the experience of working with First Nations does mean that the importance of their inclusion will be respected by all stakeholders.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision \u2026 makes a very big difference, because it will hopefully help to promote our community in the new project,\u201d Bruni-Sinoussi said, noting it also means, for example, that the North Shore Indigenous Shop Assistants are included in the policy.\nLoren and Linda Arian of the council in Okanagan Falls welcomed the announcement, saying that although not all of the municipality\u2019s 100,000 residents will be able to join the recreational communities of the Wood\u2019s Nest Lake development, the news means well for the community\u2019s economic development.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news that the province is really going to be working in partnership with us in the area of recreation,\u201d Linda Arian said.\nNelson Jennison, chair of the Okanagan Shuswap First Nation, said he couldn\u2019t speak more highly of the province\u2019s decision to include his community and that the government should be commended for supporting it on a public platform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a project that should have been done with no consultation, but I just want to thank the Ministry of Agriculture for that,\u201d he said.\nPam Krudenas of the Sprott First"}
{"title": "Fox and Friends Segment Suggests Climate Change is the Result of Friction", "text": "What a magical, inspiring time for right-wing thought. On Friday morning, Fox & Friends welcomed \u201csocial media superstars and Fox Nation contributors\u201d Diamond and Silk to discuss climate change and immigration, and if you\u2019d rather just skip ahead to the part where you bang your head against your desk, I won\u2019t blame you.\nIn case you don\u2019t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here\u2019s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to be expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year.\nThe climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it\u2019s not due to the pollution we\u2019re spewing into the sky. It\u2019s not carbon or methane. It is, I guess, friction, and the purpose of the Green New Deal is to literally stop the Earth from turning, and reset it. This is a thing that was said on television this very morning, and your Dad watched it, and so did the president of the United States, and all of them echoed Silk\u2019s assessment: \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d\nThe hosts then turned their attention to Beto O\u2019Rourke, who at a recent campaign event called President Trump out for painting Mexicans as \u201crapists\u201d and asylum seekers as \u201canimals.\u201d Asked to respond to O\u2019Rourke, Diamond said this, and I am not kidding: \u201cWhen I listen to Beto O\u2019Rourke, his rhetoric, it reminds me of a slave owner. Anytime you want to tear down existing walls, and allow poor people to flow into our country, and have them living in the shadows, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.\u201d\nIf you were wondering whether they mentioned our president, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just kidding, you weren\u2019t wondering that. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke need to look at himself,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cAnd his own rhetoric,\u201d Silk chimed in. \u201cRight. Is what he need to do,\u201d Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just $5.99 a month.\nFox News\u2014really, cable news in general\u2014is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but \u201cclimate change is because the Earth is speeding\u201d and \u201cimmigration reform is slavery\u201d are both alarmingly stupid ideas. And once again, there is a one-hundred percent chance the president is watching and nodding along.\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with bestiality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images\nAll of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don\u2019t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising Democratic Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant Christian who supports a woman\u2019s right to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for \u201csaying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.\u201d Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, nearly all claim to be Christian. So it is interesting that only the first-ever openly gay one gets to be the subject of this headline:\nMayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Bestiality.\nThe claim itself is too ignorant to put any energy into rebutting, but it does bear pointing out to my right-wing gay grifters out there: this is what they think of you. Whether you try to fit into their definition of respectable or not, even if you go on Tucker Carlson and eat a Chick-Fil-A sandwich, when push comes to shove, you\u2019re no better than a goat-fucker.\nIs everything getting dumber, or are we just dizzy because the world is spinning so fast?\n", "summary": "Diamond and Silk told Fox News viewers that climate change is real\u2014but the result of the earth rotating.", "authors": "Dave Holmes", "publish_date": "04-05-2019", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27056109/fox-and-friends-diamond-and-silk-climate-change/", "domain": "esquire.com", "warc_date": "2019-04-19T23:49:39Z", "split": "test", "inst_index": 51645, "top_ps": [0.9599999785423279], "gens_article": "It was a sobering and illuminating bit of scientific and social commentary from America's morning news program this morning. On Thursday's Fox & Friends, host Steve Doocy and co-host Gretchen Carlson opened up a pretty dismal segment by dishing out dire and excitable news, introducing it by declaring that climate change is what \"we're facing now. There's no doubt about it.\"\nFor about a half hour, Steve Doocy and Gretchen Carlson used relentless repetition of outdated theories to drive home their concerns. \"Last year, the temperatures increased by 2.5 to 3 inches in certain areas of the United States,\" Carlson said. \"Remember that warm past three days,\" Carlson said, \"as opposed to just the last week or two?\" For seven more minutes, the panel dove headlong into classic climate change talking points, often employing the pun \u201cFor all intents and purposes, climate change,\" implying that the excess heat was caused by humans. When it was time for weather experts to walk us through what it would take to end climate change, Carlson asserted, \"it\u2019s got to be fairly drastic. So we need to institute more renewable energy, less carbon dioxide, and move toward other forms of energy.\" Finally, when Carlson cut to an illustrated spread about forest fires, she asked, \"Is there any chance that climate change is the one thing that happens every year that becomes the problem?\" Fox & Friends got a brief jolt in the sixth and final segment, however, when the segment turned to the war on terror and its impact on the planet. All the the foundation for Doocy and Carlson's arguments was set. First, the terror attacks in 2001 followed a \"natural phenomenon,\" the rise in sea levels caused by melting glaciers. Second, the shift to oil and gas, particularly fracking, is a response to the loss of productive land and a long, slow process of changing the fossil fuel sector. Indeed, though this business is dedicated to climate change deniers, Dr. Robert W. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, has appeared in front of Fox & Friends insisting that the terror attacks were not connected to climate change.\nThe segment will be familiar to doomsayers everywhere, now that Fox News' presence on Rush Limbaugh's radio show sparked a backlash last summer that literally destroyed the Fox and Friends network. After Limbaugh blasted left-wing billionaire George Soros and corporations involved in climate change science (like GE), Fox News stepped into the fray. And now, they've done it again, prompting these Fox & Friends segments. It's all come together, and the media's on side. Speaking of Fox News, according to a new Fox News report, Beck has begun to use the weather as his main public metric of success. As previously reported, the Fox and Friends segment highlighted storm activity in January and February, which is historically bad news, and Beck also had a segment this week celebrating average temperature by showing the temperature outside his studio.
