The municipality is expected to spend about $9 million of public money to bring timber to the communities where it is found.\n \u201cWe do believe in taking a holistic approach to where this business is going, and we believe that it is possible for companies outside the sector that can provide a greater customer base and a greater opportunity to benefit from this,\u201d said Mr. Horgan, who has called for more skilled workers to take care of the industry, with more jobs. \u201cWe have seen, for that matter, so much growth and so much value in this industry in so many ways now that you call this industry \u2019The Great Wall,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this business.\u201d But even though U.S. companies had been trying to figure out how they could better share revenue, a shift in the company model is coming to an end.\n This could be an indication of the direction the industry is taking to improve its standing in the industry. \u201cChina has the largest volume of timber in the world at its disposal and a large timber market and is a world leader in global timber logging and production,\u201d said David Dienst, CEO of the international consulting firm Timber International. \u201cIt will allow for significant reduction in the number of jobs in the wood and timber industry.

The municipality is expected to spend about $9 million of public money to bring timber to the communities where it is found.\n \u201cWe do believe in taking a holistic approach to where this business is going, and we believe that it is possible for companies outside the sector that can provide a greater customer base and a greater opportunity to benefit from this,\u201d said Mr. Horgan, who has called for more skilled workers to take care of the industry, with more jobs. \u201cWe have seen, for that matter, so much growth and so much value in this industry in so many ways now that you call this industry \u2019The Great Wall,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this business.\u201d But even though U.S. companies had been trying to figure out how they could better share revenue, a shift in the company model is coming to an end.\n This could be an indication of the direction the industry is taking to improve its standing in the industry. \u201cChina has the largest volume of timber in the world at its disposal and a large timber market and is a world leader in global timber logging and production,\u201d said David Dienst, CEO of the international consulting firm Timber International. \u201cIt will allow for significant reduction in the number of jobs in the wood and timber industry. For this, the government is continuing its drive to improve productivity in the wood industry. We believe the government\u2019s effort will have a positive impact on the market.\u201d\n Lamar said Trump\u2019s words could open the way for other industries to use the opportunity for political capital to come by for others to invest their money. \u201cThere may come when that economic opportunity is already there,\u201d he said. \u2026 But he said that in the meantime, the economy won\u2019t move with the economic gains it would. \u201cThere may even be some [business investment opportunities], but then again, just because the people that invest don\u2019t invest doesn\u2019t mean you get you much capital. You don**t get it much at the high end, but there are certainly certain people that come out and make a name for themselves\u2014whether it\u2019s making a good point out of that or just not wanting to spend a lot of money. And that\u2019s not going to happen if we don\u2019t give them as much opportunity as they have.\u201d \u2020\n Horgan\u2019s meeting Tuesday with First Nation leaders comes after First Nations leaders in Victoria last week introduced legislation to amend the B.C. Biosafety Act to include information about tree damage, where damage may be, and compensation for those who lose their sight or hearing. The Cascades and the B.C.\u2013area of First Nations rights are among the most protected assets on the B.C., with a top ten population and top 15 per cent of the world\u2019s reserves.

In an interview with SPACE.com, NASA\u2019s deputy administrator for NASA\u2019s space program, Brian Leary, said that the company\u2019s view was that there are few other things NASA holds in common \u2014 if any other things besides the common interest. The company also argued that while it had been working to improve the company\u2019s business climate, the government has shown little willingness to listen.\n The letter asks the agency to include a national pilot for enhanced passenger security, which can be deployed on the first stop along the GO route on Monday, at both the border and into the communities along the route. It asks that companies \u201cdemonstrate leadership, commitment and responsiveness\u201d in setting the safety goals to which they are putting their business. The letter calls on companies to ensure they comply with a \u201chigh level of safety measures that provide certainty, security and a low risk of collisions.\u201d\n In a memorandum sent to investors Friday, Horgan outlined that a new timber export licence would be granted under the proposal. But the provincial government decided to stop it, saying it\u2019s too risky for the province\u2019s economy and the development of an industry that accounts for less than 1-2 per cent of the province\u2019s exports, leaving it up to the province to get the $30bn in new permits it wants. But if B.C. is serious about moving into a new forestry industry, Horgan said he is \u201cconfident the province\u201d will get it. \u201cThe reason the provincial government has decided not to pursue any large-scale public forestry project in B.C. at this time is to show that provincial investment is viable \u2014 with an endowment that will go anywhere,\u201d it said.\nHowever, Yurkovich said industry representatives are still figuring out Horgan\u2019s offer to take part in the engagement process for revitalizing the Interior\u2019s forest industry.\n\u201cI understand there is a desire to have a process to address challenges in the Interior and do that collectively, and of course I\u2019m supportive of that,\u201d Yurkovich said. \u201c(But) I don\u2019t fully understand the process.\u201d\nJohn Rustad, the MLA for Nechako Lakes and the B.C.

The Cascades and the B.C.\u2013area of First Nations rights are among the most protected assets on the B.C., with a top ten population and top 15 per cent of the world\u2019s reserves.

Linda Chatterjee, principal economist with the Environment and Sustainable Growth Research Institute and executive director of the Wood and Forestry Research Institute at the University of B.C. and a co-author of the report, said the initiative would mean an important contribution to the economy of the country, and would also provide a pathway to economic development. \u201cIt will create jobs by providing sustainable growth opportunities over much longer periods,\u201d she warned.\n How to fix roads An updated infrastructure plan that provides better service to the public that allows the construction of more roads through the community would be a long awaited one. In a state of emergency because of a wildfire that has killed five people in St. Paul, many local governments have already begun to work on a major part of that task.\n Horgan said that during the initial years of Canada\u2019s economic recovery, most of the public was still unfamiliar with how timber was raised and sold. However, during the last 18 years, it has increased rapidly, according to Horgan \u201cwith a total of 3,500 public services being raised in 2016, with approximately 12,500 of those being located in Prince Edward Island and Stampede.\u201d The public also will benefit through the sale of the timber as well, including the sale of a parcel to a residential community. The municipality is expected to spend about $9 million of public money to bring timber to the communities where it is found.\n \u201cWe do believe in taking a holistic approach to where this business is going, and we believe that it is possible for companies outside the sector that can provide a greater customer base and a greater opportunity to benefit from this,\u201d said Mr. Horgan, who has called for more skilled workers to take care of the industry, with more jobs. \u201cWe have seen, for that matter, so much growth and so much value in this industry in so many ways now that you call this industry \u2019The Great Wall,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this business.\u201d But even though U.S. companies had been trying to figure out how they could better share revenue, a shift in the company model is coming to an end.\n This could be an indication of the direction the industry is taking to improve its standing in the industry. \u201cChina has the largest volume of timber in the world at its disposal and a large timber market and is a world leader in global timber logging and production,\u201d said David Dienst, CEO of the international consulting firm Timber International. \u201cIt will allow for significant reduction in the number of jobs in the wood and timber industry. For this, the government is continuing its drive to improve productivity in the wood industry. We believe the government\u2019s effort will have a positive impact on the market.\u201d\n Lamar said Trump\u2019s words could open the way for other industries to use the opportunity for political capital to come by for others to invest their money. \u201cThere may come when that economic opportunity is already there,\u201d he said. \u2026 But he said that in the meantime, the economy won\u2019t move with the economic gains it would. \u201cThere may even be some [business investment opportunities], but then again, just because the people that invest don\u2019t invest doesn\u2019t mean you get you much capital. You don**t get it much at the high end, but there are certainly certain people that come out and make a name for themselves\u2014whether it\u2019s making a good point out of that or just not wanting to spend a lot of money. And that\u2019s not going to happen if we don\u2019t give them as much opportunity as they have.\u201d \u2020\n Horgan\u2019s meeting Tuesday with First Nation leaders comes after First Nations leaders in Victoria last week introduced legislation to amend the B.C. Biosafety Act to include information about tree damage, where damage may be, and compensation for those who lose their sight or hearing. The Cascades and the B.C.\u2013area of First Nations rights are among the most protected assets on the B.C., with a top ten population and top 15 per cent of the world\u2019s reserves. First Nations have long expressed concern about how Canada\u2019s vast resources might undermine their own resources and the interests of local First Nations.\n However, in its latest briefing, NASA, one of the country\u2019s premier commercial space agencies, called for the government to rethink its view. In an interview with SPACE.com, NASA\u2019s deputy administrator for NASA\u2019s space program, Brian Leary, said that the company\u2019s view was that there are few other things NASA holds in common \u2014 if any other things besides the common interest. The company also argued that while it had been working to improve the company\u2019s business climate, the government has shown little willingness to listen.\n The letter asks the agency to include a national pilot for enhanced passenger security, which can be deployed on the first stop along the GO route on Monday, at both the border and into the communities along the route. It asks that companies \u201cdemonstrate leadership, commitment and responsiveness\u201d in setting the safety goals to which they are putting their business. The letter calls on companies to ensure they comply with a \u201chigh level of safety measures that provide certainty, security and a low risk of collisions.\u201d\n In a memorandum sent to investors Friday, Horgan outlined that a new timber export licence would be granted under the proposal. But the provincial government decided to stop it, saying it\u2019s too risky for the province\u2019s economy and the development of an industry that accounts for less than 1-2 per cent of the province\u2019s exports, leaving it up to the province to get the $30bn in new permits it wants. But if B.C. is serious about moving into a new forestry industry, Horgan said he is \u201cconfident the province\u201d will get it. \u201cThe reason the provincial government has decided not to pursue any large-scale public forestry project in B.C. at this time is to show that provincial investment is viable \u2014 with an endowment that will go anywhere,\u201d it said.\n She\u2019s met with industry leaders in the industry and is meeting with the CEO of the largest oil sands company in the United States, Saudi Aramco. The meeting today also marked the first time COFI has gone through the steps necessary to meet the needs of the communities that depend on oil sands extraction.\n Yurkovich told the Post: \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this [urban rehabilitation] a priority in the future. We want to get the land back at least to 2,000 feet, then maybe even up to 300 feet and then some.\u201d\n The BLM needs to continue to work with the Interior and with stakeholders, and it may not be in keeping with a specific environmental goal. When there are issues like these, they have to be sorted through. We\u201cll be working in collaboration with the BLM and with people from agencies and states who are coming out and saying what they want and asking questions, and that\u2019s what this is about and I feel that it is necessary,\u2016 Yurkovich said. However, there are always unintended effects like this.

If the BLM cannot find one of the issues on which they would most benefit as the chief of staff, and it really isn\u2019t in cooperation, then that doesn\u200ft mean that there won\u2019t be work to be done to see things through and to provide an avenue for people from across the country to work together.\u2016 Yurkovich said that in general.\n In the past 13 months, he said, that uncertainty has increased dramatically \u201cThese investment policies have made no significant progress in making the region a more equitable financial situation for all Canadians. This needs to change as well. It\u2019s not just economic policy that has allowed the past three years \u2014 it\u2019s also regulatory policy,\u201d said Rustad.\n \u201cHow can we make the industry more competitive?\u201d they asked. \u201cA lot of what makes this industry so great are these companies that are making the capital investment and the investments to grow at a high rate. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the industry to start doing that, and then to make that competitive.\u201c Michal said that while the country needs to get more out of the Chinese manufacturing sector, they\u2019re still not all going to be profitable so any reforms are best taken.\n\n The first \u201cchampagne\u201d comes from the restaurant where the couple is staying in La Prima Blanca. A couple days early, the couple came across a piece of charcoal and the restaurant owner took it out and placed it inside his home. According to a witness, the grill saw two black and white items in the middle of the charcoal and just a moment later his wife looked up and saw what appeared to be a black and white weapon and then looked at all three. As she began seeing him, her husband immediately grabbed her hands and told her to get back to the kitchen door. She grabbed the chair from the chair and started laughing loudly in the kitchen as he pushed her out. She got back into the back seat, where the fire extinguisher had been placed outside, screaming for help. The fire stopped at the top of the steps about 5:30 a.m.\n Is there more to this story? We\u2019d like to hear from you about this or any other stories you think we should know about.

Their return home will coincide with a family get-together at their house. In attendance will be my 20-something niece and her boyfriend \u2014 whose behavior needs improvement. He\u2019s a nice guy otherwise, but he is evidently unaware of how to carry himself thoughtfully.\nAt my parents\u2019 60th wedding anniversary party, for example, he and my niece occupied the only prime space, directly across from my parents, using my parents as a backdrop for their make-out session.\nI would have preferred those two seats be occupied by my brother and me, so we could be physically close to my parents during this celebration of their marriage. At Christmas at my parents\u2019 house, my niece\u2019s boyfriend occupied/reserved the front of the buffet line while everyone else helped to prepare it. He stood there (literally) wiping his dripping nose with his fingers and then transferring those drippings to the serving utensil he picked up immediately afterward.\nI\u2019m afraid if I say anything (praise in public, coach in private) my youngest brother will hear, go ballistic and temporarily avoid family functions, which would devastate my 80-year-old mother.

Once I realized that my order interrupts her morning prep work, I have now minimized those requests. On several occasions, I\u2019ve even apologized to her for placing the order.\nBut recently I ordered a sandwich later in the day and got the same unfriendly response. And now I have begun to wonder whether this is her problem, or mine.\nThere is no restriction posted on when a sandwich can be ordered. So what do I do? Say something to her? Say something to the manager?

And I thought, I have to be very clear. People don\u2019t understand the importance of parental control. I have said that a great deal that the world needs is that their children not understand how to treat others, or care for children. I was told, you know, that we\u2019re children of God, and our parents are my mom, my sister, my stepfather, and mine (though I don\u2019t recall their name being mentioned), so I never thought about what the family thinks about other children. So I\u2019m saying that some of this will come to a point with my kid so I think it\u2019s time to put the parents at the forefront. I can\u2019t just sit\n Get real. As I am on Facebook, I am in a position where I can read whatever material I want while staying in sync with my brain. The idea behind this is that I can communicate.

If your weight is going to be above it\u2019s normal, put it in a weight loss box or box for children to see it. (This doesn\u2019t have to be a medical question.) This will help you to set a healthy weight.

For now though, she is just trying to make a point to have the conversation go away.\n\n\n This is a man who was able to get back to his life despite working for a long time under so many abusive ex-employees, and his health wasn\u2019t taken care of. Yet to think it was all taken care of is disgusting. I found myself waiting for three more hours in my car waiting for a call, for another call, to see my beloved dog, again. My family was gone, my friends and the kids. I wish I could have cried for hours without the stress. That was the feeling every kid wants when they try to escape the system, but the other side is the worst feeling, too. These people are destroying so many lives at this point. In my world, they are the bad guys, but there is no way of knowing, for example, that these people are going to succeed. They are creating the problem to get what works, then their problem, then the bad people\u2019s solution, then the good people\u2019s solution, then the bad people\u2019s solution. This has to stop. We all try, but nobody stops us. And that could mean either\n You don\u2019t have to have a sandwich in the office to be happy. Your staff is better at what they do every day. When there is an issue of lack of quality that can no longer be addressed, you can resolve it through personal interaction, without sacrificing any sense of professionalism or responsibility. When an employee wants to order a slice with only your signature, you don\u2019t have to act as though anyone else is going to buy it. The time has come for you to go step by step. My hope, and what I do every day, is to get a sandwich ready quickly that is appropriate for my employees. When I\u2019m in a bad mood, I will do something that will make my boss happier. When I\u2019m getting on the right track, I will use my time to help my staff in other areas as well!\n In regards to the other case they have of an old friend, I have heard that she was the one who tried to attack the man that she had been stalking. This man called me and told me he was gonna burn with her. I told him that he\u2019s doing it to take vengeance on her, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to imagine how he would feel about it. Then you came to me with the news and asked me if I had anything going on. I said yeah, but it is hard to explain after everything the people who have been watching the case are still scared of this case, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want to lose them as long as I can make them go to jail, what I need isn\u2019t to worry about it over and over again.

Their return home will coincide with a family get-together at their house. In attendance will be my 20-something niece and her boyfriend \u2014 whose behavior needs improvement. He\u2019s a nice guy otherwise, but he is evidently unaware of how to carry himself thoughtfully.\n Amy: In our school, you do your homework and watch TV. He is not around to learn how to read or write. I asked what he was doing during the day. he told me he was reading and writing, reading from his phone, watching YouTube, downloading a game or downloading video games. Amy: Yes, absolutely. He told me he was working at home in the office while I stayed at home. I told him to watch Netflix. My boyfriend tells me to get out. He told me that it was nice to sleep in. He\u2019s always there when I\u2019m up for anything.\n And as the girls, who had never danced before, made clear their \u201ccool dad\u201d vibe with the dancing as they approached, he was immediately there for all the other guests. And while I was waiting for them to arrive, he, with the other bridesmaids, arrived by themselves, all of the while laughing along as the festivities wore on.\n\n\n\n \nThe family has been at the forefront of all our discussion about what happens to children and how it happens to adults, but I would like to add that I agree with you. That was the whole point of our first meeting in October. I remember giving a book signing\u2014I love this genre of writing\u2014where I was trying to write some kind of parenting piece. But what I didn\u2019t get to see was the family\u2019s support. They had been supportive too much for a long time. I was telling myself that for these adults, this is what they\u2019d want. And I thought, I have to be very clear. People don\u2019t understand the importance of parental control. I have said that a great deal that the world needs is that their children not understand how to treat others, or care for children. I was told, you know, that we\u2019re children of God, and our parents are my mom, my sister, my stepfather, and mine (though I don\u2019t recall their name being mentioned), so I never thought about what the family thinks about other children. So I\u2019m saying that some of this will come to a point with my kid so I think it\u2019s time to put the parents at the forefront. I can\u2019t just sit\n Get real. As I am on Facebook, I am in a position where I can read whatever material I want while staying in sync with my brain. The idea behind this is that I can communicate. So in my social zone I can sit in comfortable, comfortable places, and I can also think and even change my mind at will through actions.\n Parents who want their children to play with their kids - How much do you charge for an Adult Time Off? \u00bb The latest on child care: Parents who choose child care at school - What\u2019s your take on child care? \u00bb\n As a family, we must have a normal weight when we come into the dining room. If your weight is going to be above it\u2019s normal, put it in a weight loss box or box for children to see it. (This doesn\u2019t have to be a medical question.) This will help you to set a healthy weight. While children can sit and sit in place for 10 minutes while we watch their food before and after we are seated, this is not really going to make it any less safe for them. A lot of people don\u2019t go for a sit-alone meal and we\n She spoke as she did the word for the rest of the discussion of the story. It did sound like a couple was trying to be nice, but they were both very vocal about their anger and confusion at having to go back and change their lives so quickly. For now though, she is just trying to make a point to have the conversation go away.\n\n\n This is a man who was able to get back to his life despite working for a long time under so many abusive ex-employees, and his health wasn\u2019t taken care of. Yet to think it was all taken care of is disgusting. I found myself waiting for three more hours in my car waiting for a call, for another call, to see my beloved dog, again. My family was gone, my friends and the kids. I wish I could have cried for hours without the stress. That was the feeling every kid wants when they try to escape the system, but the other side is the worst feeling, too. These people are destroying so many lives at this point. In my world, they are the bad guys, but there is no way of knowing, for example, that these people are going to succeed. They are creating the problem to get what works, then their problem, then the bad people\u2019s solution, then the good people\u2019s solution, then the bad people\u2019s solution. This has to stop. We all try, but nobody stops us. And that could mean either\n You don\u2019t have to have a sandwich in the office to be happy. Your staff is better at what they do every day. When there is an issue of lack of quality that can no longer be addressed, you can resolve it through personal interaction, without sacrificing any sense of professionalism or responsibility. When an employee wants to order a slice with only your signature, you don\u2019t have to act as though anyone else is going to buy it. The time has come for you to go step by step. My hope, and what I do every day, is to get a sandwich ready quickly that is appropriate for my employees. When I\u2019m in a bad mood, I will do something that will make my boss happier. When I\u2019m getting on the right track, I will use my time to help my staff in other areas as well!\n In regards to the other case they have of an old friend, I have heard that she was the one who tried to attack the man that she had been stalking. This man called me and told me he was gonna burn with her. I told him that he\u2019s doing it to take vengeance on her, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to imagine how he would feel about it. Then you came to me with the news and asked me if I had anything going on. I said yeah, but it is hard to explain after everything the people who have been watching the case are still scared of this case, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want to lose them as long as I can make them go to jail, what I need isn\u2019t to worry about it over and over again.

The meeting was convened by the council when Ms Foster led its Brexit strategy review and warned that the council\u2019s Brexit consultation was \u201can inadequate, if necessary, model for other important councils\u201d.\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity for Labour if we are clear. But lack of clarity would cost us support not only in these elections but it will feed through into the next general election and that may not be far away.\u201d\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn\u2019s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be \u201can NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders\u201d. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet \u2013 Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson \u2013 are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\n\u201cIt would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader\u2019s office,\u201d said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties \u2013 the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) \u2013 while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party\u2019s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\nOne senior party figure said: \u201cThe result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.\u201d\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson\u2019s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.\u201d\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement. He said: \u201cMost Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s recent comments about a customs union \u2013 that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cIf this is indeed the case, then it\u2019s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum. The first task should be to get a \u2018Labour-shaped\u2019 deal agreed and embedded in the withdrawal agreement so it was not able to be ripped up by future Tory leader.\n\u201cThere will then of course be ample opportunity for colleagues to press their case for a second referendum on the basis of this renegotiated deal by attaching an amendment to the legislation needed to implement Brexit.\u201d\n", "summary": "A generation of young people could desert the party, says Richard Corbett, leader of Labour MEPs", "authors": "Jon Cruddas, Nick Lowles", "publish_date": "04-13-2019", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/13/corbyn-told-back-eu-referendum-or-lose-millions-voters-brexit", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2019-04-18T10:30:54Z", "split": "test", "label": "machine"}

He has been warned by Labour MPs that the party\u2019s leadership is divided by the threat of Brexit before the referendum, which he says could trigger an \u201curgent revolt\u201d.\n Tucker is a prominent figure in the anti-EU party UKIP which has won fewer than three party seats since April 2015 and has enjoyed widespread support in both parties. Corbett is believed to have raised concerns about its future in his remarks by saying Theresa May needed to \u201cdo more for Brexit and for my country\u201d after she promised to work on a vote on Brexit.\n It could also be that the Eurosceptic movement in England has shifted under the current Tory leadership. If Remainers were to make the choice between Brexit, an irreversible blow to British trade and higher taxes - and the Tories may have to pay their way out of the referendum - then they might be better off staying in Europe and staying in the European Union, rather than being more isolationist - to try to find their way out of the chaos of the Brexit negotiations. For many Remainers, this may be just what they wish they could do. Many of them see that a pro-business government could solve Britain\u2019s problems and make it better for the middle class, an opposition that the Leave campaign insists is being hijacked by outside interests.\n He said: \u2010Given that it is now fully clear to MPs that we accept its position but not before we take the issue to the vote, we remain committed to an independent referendum for a two-no Brexit deal for a range of key policy areas. There is another Labour option, a motion for a parliamentary vote on a referendum, but the option would be to accept only two separate, not competing parties to vote for a single, binding vote on issues such as a second referendum on membership of the European single market.\n On his trip to Africa, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cI would hope that Europe were not concerned with this issue because they may lose a few million Muslims by their actions in that country. \u201dBut I feel that there should be no justification for this so that they deal with it head on.\u201c If the Tories fail to take action against ISIL, he added, \u201dwe are going to lose more Muslim lives.\u201c\n But one source close to the negotiations says that \u201cin principle\u201d this would allow a vote with the Tories, only to find themselves holding the option of a second referendum rather than simply letting the question before UK voters. If a vote becomes a \u201cyes\u201d to a Conservative deal, it would mark an end to the Tory leader\u2019s attempt to keep the negotiating position of keeping the \u201cone in this situation,\u201d the source says.\n Ms Foster is the former shadow cabinet minister and chair of the London School of Economics, and she will also serve on the council\u2019s executive committee about Brexit, which will assess and recommend a final agreement between the Government and Brussels on how to deliver a \u2019hard Brexit\u2019 for Britain.

That\u2019s their message for the party, not me, and for Labour, and I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d\n \u201cPeople are very undecided as to how the UK should become a permanent member of the EU. The Tories seem to be quite on board with that, with some 62% saying they would vote for remaining EU and 24% believing the Union would leave the single market and customs union, leaving them with just 12% saying it would leave the EU. This means a \u2019no\u2019 \u2013 just 6% \u2013 in all. The majority of respondents, however\n One of these is from the Green Party to the Nationalist Party, one to the Scottish Independence campaign, one to the Labour party including in Scotland. This is where most of the party\u2019s leadership in Europe say this month is best for them because there was no \u2019normal Brexit\u2019. According to party insiders, at the last General Election the only party that had a clear leader to go after was the Independent People\u2019s Party (ICP), which the party\u2019s political director has been sacked.\n \u201cI see it as an example of the party\u2019s leadership that it is not trying to destroy Labour. For this party, he is a leader who believes that every vote counts. We cannot win. We have to take responsibility and to fight until Labour gets back to saying that we have a long term agenda. On Monday, I want Jeremy Corbyn to lead this party. I do not see it as a problem \u2013 I see it as an opportunity. \u201dHe is not merely the MP, he represents this party. The leader has a moral duty as far as it goes \u2013 to hold his party to that same moral honour. He is not just someone who is unashamedly opposed to the EU, he represents this party together.\u201c\nAt the last European elections in 2014 \u2013 in which Ukip won the most seats \u2013 responsibility for writing Labour\u2019s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\nHe said: \u201cA Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson\u2019s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.\u201d\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement. He said: \u201cMost Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s recent comments about a customs union \u2013 that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cIf this is indeed the case, then it\u2019s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum. The first task should be to get a \u2018Labour-shaped\u2019 deal agreed and embedded in the withdrawal agreement so it was not able to be ripped up by future Tory leader.\n\u201cThere will then of course be ample opportunity for colleagues to press their case for a second referendum on the basis of this renegotiated deal by attaching an amendment to the legislation needed to implement Brexit.\u201d\n", "summary": "A generation of young people could desert the party, says Richard Corbett, leader of Labour MEPs", "authors": "Jon Cruddas, Nick Lowles", "publish_date": "04-13-2019", "status": "success", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/13/corbyn-told-back-eu-referendum-or-lose-millions-voters-brexit", "domain": "theguardian.com", "warc_date": "2019-04-18T10:30:54Z", "split": "test", "label": "machine"}

He has been warned by Labour MPs that the party\u2019s leadership is divided by the threat of Brexit before the referendum, which he says could trigger an \u201curgent revolt\u201d.\n Tucker is a prominent figure in the anti-EU party UKIP which has won fewer than three party seats since April 2015 and has enjoyed widespread support in both parties. Corbett is believed to have raised concerns about its future in his remarks by saying Theresa May needed to \u201cdo more for Brexit and for my country\u201d after she promised to work on a vote on Brexit.\n It could also be that the Eurosceptic movement in England has shifted under the current Tory leadership. If Remainers were to make the choice between Brexit, an irreversible blow to British trade and higher taxes - and the Tories may have to pay their way out of the referendum - then they might be better off staying in Europe and staying in the European Union, rather than being more isolationist - to try to find their way out of the chaos of the Brexit negotiations. For many Remainers, this may be just what they wish they could do. Many of them see that a pro-business government could solve Britain\u2019s problems and make it better for the middle class, an opposition that the Leave campaign insists is being hijacked by outside interests.\n He said: \u2010Given that it is now fully clear to MPs that we accept its position but not before we take the issue to the vote, we remain committed to an independent referendum for a two-no Brexit deal for a range of key policy areas. There is another Labour option, a motion for a parliamentary vote on a referendum, but the option would be to accept only two separate, not competing parties to vote for a single, binding vote on issues such as a second referendum on membership of the European single market.\n On his trip to Africa, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cI would hope that Europe were not concerned with this issue because they may lose a few million Muslims by their actions in that country. \u201dBut I feel that there should be no justification for this so that they deal with it head on.\u201c If the Tories fail to take action against ISIL, he added, \u201dwe are going to lose more Muslim lives.\u201c\n But one source close to the negotiations says that \u201cin principle\u201d this would allow a vote with the Tories, only to find themselves holding the option of a second referendum rather than simply letting the question before UK voters. If a vote becomes a \u201cyes\u201d to a Conservative deal, it would mark an end to the Tory leader\u2019s attempt to keep the negotiating position of keeping the \u201cone in this situation,\u201d the source says.\n Ms Foster is the former shadow cabinet minister and chair of the London School of Economics, and she will also serve on the council\u2019s executive committee about Brexit, which will assess and recommend a final agreement between the Government and Brussels on how to deliver a \u2019hard Brexit\u2019 for Britain. She will also run pro-Brexit policy-making for the council, which will include senior advisers such as Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team chair Andrew Mitchell, and Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team leader, Caroline Hodge, among others. The meeting was convened by the council when Ms Foster led its Brexit strategy review and warned that the council\u2019s Brexit consultation was \u201can inadequate, if necessary, model for other important councils\u201d.\n Mr Corbyn said that with more MPs working with him on all matters of key issues such as immigration, he would \u201chave a clear agenda for the rest of the UK.\u201d He said: \u201cYes, to the best of my recollection, if the British people have been so frustrated by the Tory government\u2019s lack of leadership they would see the manifesto as they are, this is what it is, and I will continue to push the government through this process as the next prime minister.\u2019\u2019 On the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto the shadow foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cBut we have to go, a second referendum in the referendum campaign.

He has been warned by Labour MPs that the party\u2019s leadership is divided by the threat of Brexit before the referendum, which he says could trigger an \u201curgent revolt\u201d.\n Tucker is a prominent figure in the anti-EU party UKIP which has won fewer than three party seats since April 2015 and has enjoyed widespread support in both parties. Corbett is believed to have raised concerns about its future in his remarks by saying Theresa May needed to \u201cdo more for Brexit and for my country\u201d after she promised to work on a vote on Brexit.\n It could also be that the Eurosceptic movement in England has shifted under the current Tory leadership. If Remainers were to make the choice between Brexit, an irreversible blow to British trade and higher taxes - and the Tories may have to pay their way out of the referendum - then they might be better off staying in Europe and staying in the European Union, rather than being more isolationist - to try to find their way out of the chaos of the Brexit negotiations. For many Remainers, this may be just what they wish they could do. Many of them see that a pro-business government could solve Britain\u2019s problems and make it better for the middle class, an opposition that the Leave campaign insists is being hijacked by outside interests.\n He said: \u2010Given that it is now fully clear to MPs that we accept its position but not before we take the issue to the vote, we remain committed to an independent referendum for a two-no Brexit deal for a range of key policy areas. There is another Labour option, a motion for a parliamentary vote on a referendum, but the option would be to accept only two separate, not competing parties to vote for a single, binding vote on issues such as a second referendum on membership of the European single market.\n On his trip to Africa, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cI would hope that Europe were not concerned with this issue because they may lose a few million Muslims by their actions in that country. \u201dBut I feel that there should be no justification for this so that they deal with it head on.\u201c If the Tories fail to take action against ISIL, he added, \u201dwe are going to lose more Muslim lives.\u201c\n But one source close to the negotiations says that \u201cin principle\u201d this would allow a vote with the Tories, only to find themselves holding the option of a second referendum rather than simply letting the question before UK voters. If a vote becomes a \u201cyes\u201d to a Conservative deal, it would mark an end to the Tory leader\u2019s attempt to keep the negotiating position of keeping the \u201cone in this situation,\u201d the source says.\n Ms Foster is the former shadow cabinet minister and chair of the London School of Economics, and she will also serve on the council\u2019s executive committee about Brexit, which will assess and recommend a final agreement between the Government and Brussels on how to deliver a \u2019hard Brexit\u2019 for Britain. She will also run pro-Brexit policy-making for the council, which will include senior advisers such as Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team chair Andrew Mitchell, and Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team leader, Caroline Hodge, among others. The meeting was convened by the council when Ms Foster led its Brexit strategy review and warned that the council\u2019s Brexit consultation was \u201can inadequate, if necessary, model for other important councils\u201d.\n Mr Corbyn said that with more MPs working with him on all matters of key issues such as immigration, he would \u201chave a clear agenda for the rest of the UK.\u201d He said: \u201cYes, to the best of my recollection, if the British people have been so frustrated by the Tory government\u2019s lack of leadership they would see the manifesto as they are, this is what it is, and I will continue to push the government through this process as the next prime minister.\u2019\u2019 On the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto the shadow foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cBut we have to go, a second referendum in the referendum campaign.

The Tories seem to be quite on board with that, with some 62% saying they would vote for remaining EU and 24% believing the Union would leave the single market and customs union, leaving them with just 12% saying it would leave the EU.

According to party insiders, at the last General Election the only party that had a clear leader to go after was the Independent People\u2019s Party (ICP), which the party\u2019s political director has been sacked.\n \u201cI see it as an example of the party\u2019s leadership that it is not trying to destroy Labour.

On Monday, I want Jeremy Corbyn to lead this party. I do not see it as a problem \u2013 I see it as an opportunity. \u201dHe is not merely the MP, he represents this party. The leader has a moral duty as far as it goes \u2013 to hold his party to that same moral honour.

Corbett is believed to have raised concerns about its future in his remarks by saying Theresa May needed to \u201cdo more for Brexit and for my country\u201d after she promised to work on a vote on Brexit.\n It could also be that the Eurosceptic movement in England has shifted under the current Tory leadership. If Remainers were to make the choice between Brexit, an irreversible blow to British trade and higher taxes - and the Tories may have to pay their way out of the referendum - then they might be better off staying in Europe and staying in the European Union, rather than being more isolationist - to try to find their way out of the chaos of the Brexit negotiations. For many Remainers, this may be just what they wish they could do. Many of them see that a pro-business government could solve Britain\u2019s problems and make it better for the middle class, an opposition that the Leave campaign insists is being hijacked by outside interests.\n He said: \u2010Given that it is now fully clear to MPs that we accept its position but not before we take the issue to the vote, we remain committed to an independent referendum for a two-no Brexit deal for a range of key policy areas. There is another Labour option, a motion for a parliamentary vote on a referendum, but the option would be to accept only two separate, not competing parties to vote for a single, binding vote on issues such as a second referendum on membership of the European single market.\n On his trip to Africa, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cI would hope that Europe were not concerned with this issue because they may lose a few million Muslims by their actions in that country. \u201dBut I feel that there should be no justification for this so that they deal with it head on.\u201c If the Tories fail to take action against ISIL, he added, \u201dwe are going to lose more Muslim lives.\u201c\n But one source close to the negotiations says that \u201cin principle\u201d this would allow a vote with the Tories, only to find themselves holding the option of a second referendum rather than simply letting the question before UK voters. If a vote becomes a \u201cyes\u201d to a Conservative deal, it would mark an end to the Tory leader\u2019s attempt to keep the negotiating position of keeping the \u201cone in this situation,\u201d the source says.\n Ms Foster is the former shadow cabinet minister and chair of the London School of Economics, and she will also serve on the council\u2019s executive committee about Brexit, which will assess and recommend a final agreement between the Government and Brussels on how to deliver a \u2019hard Brexit\u2019 for Britain. She will also run pro-Brexit policy-making for the council, which will include senior advisers such as Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team chair Andrew Mitchell, and Brexit\u2019s chief Brexit team leader, Caroline Hodge, among others. The meeting was convened by the council when Ms Foster led its Brexit strategy review and warned that the council\u2019s Brexit consultation was \u201can inadequate, if necessary, model for other important councils\u201d.\n Mr Corbyn said that with more MPs working with him on all matters of key issues such as immigration, he would \u201chave a clear agenda for the rest of the UK.\u201d He said: \u201cYes, to the best of my recollection, if the British people have been so frustrated by the Tory government\u2019s lack of leadership they would see the manifesto as they are, this is what it is, and I will continue to push the government through this process as the next prime minister.\u2019\u2019 On the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto the shadow foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cBut we have to go, a second referendum in the referendum campaign. The Conservatives haven\u2019t made a public promise yet and I don\u2019t think that the British public will agree that they are more than halfway through their term of office.\n \u2022 This article was amended on 18/4/2017. An earlier version inaccurately said that a party\u2019s support was based on its membership level. That statement has been corrected.\n The NEC is currently deciding to\n \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear from us, their friends and their constituents about this. That\u2019s their message for the party, not me, and for Labour, and I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d\n \u201cPeople are very undecided as to how the UK should become a permanent member of the EU. The Tories seem to be quite on board with that, with some 62% saying they would vote for remaining EU and 24% believing the Union would leave the single market and customs union, leaving them with just 12% saying it would leave the EU. This means a \u2019no\u2019 \u2013 just 6% \u2013 in all. The majority of respondents, however\n One of these is from the Green Party to the Nationalist Party, one to the Scottish Independence campaign, one to the Labour party including in Scotland. This is where most of the party\u2019s leadership in Europe say this month is best for them because there was no \u2019normal Brexit\u2019. According to party insiders, at the last General Election the only party that had a clear leader to go after was the Independent People\u2019s Party (ICP), which the party\u2019s political director has been sacked.\n \u201cI see it as an example of the party\u2019s leadership that it is not trying to destroy Labour. For this party, he is a leader who believes that every vote counts. We cannot win. We have to take responsibility and to fight until Labour gets back to saying that we have a long term agenda. On Monday, I want Jeremy Corbyn to lead this party. I do not see it as a problem \u2013 I see it as an opportunity. \u201dHe is not merely the MP, he represents this party. The leader has a moral duty as far as it goes \u2013 to hold his party to that same moral honour. He is not just someone who is unashamedly opposed to the EU, he represents this party together.\u201c\n One MP had said the party needed to re-do a poll after the election and that it does not know everything about the voters and the parties. The party received 70 per cent of the vote after a very close local election but the Electoral Commission said it was taking into account the \u201cvery large swing from Labour\u201d to Remain.\n \u201cUkip\u2019s victory doesn\u2019t allow our country any autonomy in its governance,\u201d an MP said. \u201cIt would seem that the party\u2019s only future is to make decisions that make us better off, such as building new coalitions. But this may be not a policy priority.\u201d When the Labour leadership election is called on 1 August, Theresa May, from her Conservative party, will be handed an interim majority.\n\n He added: \u2010For two years Labour was in a bind. \u2019I don\u2019t think there had been a moment when I was in doubt. The only reason now I am confident was the Labour party was in a new, stable, responsible place \u2026 I want to apologise to those who have gone missing or left in a tragic way. They deserve every penny of what they are getting in terms of government.\u2019\n The Liberal Democrats, in order to avoid the prospect of another general election where Britain elects a left-wing leader with a clear left-wing appeal, must deliver a more open and frank debate on their party\u2019s positions on key issues. The prime minister must now take part in this, and Labour must not only play a bigger role, but offer its message more support to voters. The prime minister must also demand that voters understand that the party does not want to lose its own public support. The prime minister must call for an exit deal within weeks, after a referendum vote \u2013 a mandate which should come from the people of the United Kingdom. The prime minister\u2019s promise to break with the euro, which he has called for, will leave the United Kingdom with no permanent and binding currency agreement between the three main UK economies. The Liberal Democrats must work to give Theresa May confidence in Britain\u2019s economy, which is forecast to lose 2.5 million homes. Their pledges to make sure\n\n One of the problems associated with asking a question like this if you think the Brexit negotiations are over, is that it can go down a slippery slope. You have to convince the public, the most dedicated and dedicated member of parliament, that you think that the Brexit negotiations are under way. But, in the end, if we ask them whether or not Britain is serious about leaving the EU or whether they think that is worth it, is there a way to make that seem clear or be clear?\u2021\u200dNo.There is no way at this moment to get those arguments to the public for their votes.\u2021\u200dI\u2019d imagine, if we had to, we could just get the position to the public in a different way.\u201d\u200dI am sure, there are some of us who, you know, could put something forward where that would be in the press. That will be a bit of a hassle, but certainly, that would be a very sensible course of action.
