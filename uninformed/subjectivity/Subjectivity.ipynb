       " 'text': '“It’s not just higher” under Trump, Tenpas said. “It’s off the charts.”\\nNot all that many high-ranking aides remain from the day Trump gave his inaugural address. Two-thirds of Trump’s most senior aides have left or been promoted, more than every president going back to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Tenpas’s research shows. But there are a few survivors. Amid all the tumult, some have even flourished. The keys: praising Trump, mastering skills that he values, and forging alliances in a rivalrous West Wing.\\nIf none of that works, plant yourself in front of a TV camera and impress the boss.\\nConsider Stephen Miller, the 33-year-old who started during the campaign. Miller’s portfolio is expanding. In recent weeks, Trump has given him a lead role on Miller’s pet issue—immigration policy. Trump told him: “Whatever you need, you’re empowered in this space; get it done,” a White House aide says.\\nRead: Trump’s right-hand troll\\nMiller has long wanted tougher measures to control migration to the U.S. In that respect, he’s in sync with Trump’s core voters—part of his value to the president. “He’s a policy adviser who has the pulse of the president’s base,” a former White House official says. “And like the president, he’s skeptical of the standard Washington playbook on trade and immigration.”\\nMiller is a curious case in that Trump often prizes aides who perform well on cable TV, whose coverage he devours. Over the past two years, Miller has had some epic appearances on the small screen. In a cool medium, he runs hot. But he’s defended Trump to the point that he’s nearly gotten himself thrown off the set. And make no mistake: For a White House aide, the defense, promotion, and celebration of Trump is a durable survival strategy.\\nIn an appearance last year on CNN (arguably Trump’s least favorite news outlet), Miller denounced “24 hours of negative anti-Trump hysterical coverage on this network.” As Miller attempted to drown out the host with stories about Trump’s virtues, Jake Tapper observed that he was really addressing an audience of one.\\nAides say that Miller is a popular figure inside the building, though, bringing in bagels for the staff. At a birthday party for Miller and a couple of other aides on the chief of staff’s patio, Trump made a surprise appearance.\\nAn undeniable asset is his speechwriting skills, past and present White House aides say. He has a feel for Trump’s voice—a skill that Trump believes “he can’t live without,” one former aide says.\\nMiller has also been nimble when it comes to internal White House politics. He was first thought to be an acolyte of the former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Both touted economic nationalism, putting them at odds with a globalist faction led by the former economic adviser Gary Cohn and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But Miller made certain not to alienate the globalists nor to make Bannon’s mistake of antagonizing Trump’s family.\\n',\n",

       " 'gens_article': ['But the man who denies climate change or the harmful effects of greenhouse gases hasn’t been shy about altering his policies in response to market forces. When an opponent of Trump’s tax bill, House Republican Rick Larsen, won the 2010 election, he warned his likely opponent, Representative Jim McGovern, that he would be liable to sue the president if the proposal wasn’t signed into law. The thinking in Washington that drives the compensation system for politicians is that there are easily disputed claims in a $125-per-acre county or municipal policy, as well as in some states that more than three-quarters of an acre of land might be worth far less than what the owner actually sells for. Farmers assert they would be liable for 9 percent of the tax they collect if their field is sold for over $125,000. Nationally, only about 3 to 4 percent of sales by people on the Trump president’s tax plan will be paid by farmers. (These estimates are based on calculations by the economist Alan Krueger.)\\nBetween them, Senate Democrats and the major political parties that control both chambers of Congress, the president’s political opponents could extract a significant amount of cash from the land on which the House rule originated. Or they could demand the entire amount from the president’s estate. The downside to this arrangement is that the nature of a political party can be to suppress its candidate or legislative candidate for the presidency or vice president, which in turn may stall any legislation designed to improve the economy.\\n[As we wrote in the weeks before the speech in St. Louis last month, “If a party is big enough that its public-policy ideas are in any way unpopular, they likely can make some people pay for the party’s choice of candidate, so long as those ideas survive the election cycle without being entirely unacceptable to voters.]\\nFarmers also argue that a competitive winner and a viable candidate are both important factors in policy development, including how they are hired, where they are paid, and how they operate their farms. If they can spend as much money as they want or say they can’t do without it, farmers will spend less to produce what they will sell.\\nIn a Forbes article in 2015, economist Malcolm Gladwell made a similar argument: The most consequential goal of this economy is to minimize unemployment.\\nEven if a simple commodity such as corn isn’t economically valuable for much of the year, the supply-dependent economy of a large industry like agriculture offers greater chances for success if the farmer is a large company. If there’s a short supply of basic crops such as corn, fish, and wheat, they could produce more if the farmer purchases more. But if the farmer has a small group of highly skilled employees, and maybe some very well paid ones, he or she might not want to take on more employees just for this purpose.\\nThis dynamic goes a long way toward explaining why the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 faced trouble in multiple cities: Once a mass movement, it couldn’t be left alone unless it had a strong economy behind it. (The militant pressure from the fast-food chains and other companies that forced a change in America’s economic regulations can be traced to the same economics.) The affordability of many products in other countries might make farmers balk.\\nEven if people aren’t happy with the political system in places such as Kansas, they aren’t likely to stop thinking about the cost of politics.\\n'],\n",

       "'“It’s not just higher” under Trump, Tenpas said. “It’s off the charts.”\\nNot all that many high-ranking aides remain from the day Trump gave his inaugural address. Two-thirds of Trump’s most senior aides have left or been promoted, more than every president going back to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Tenpas’s research shows. But there are a few survivors. Amid all the tumult, some have even flourished. The keys: praising Trump, mastering skills that he values, and forging alliances in a rivalrous West Wing.\\nIf none of that works, plant yourself in front of a TV camera and impress the boss.\\nConsider Stephen Miller, the 33-year-old who started during the campaign. Miller’s portfolio is expanding. In recent weeks, Trump has given him a lead role on Miller’s pet issue—immigration policy. Trump told him: “Whatever you need, you’re empowered in this space; get it done,” a White House aide says.\\nRead: Trump’s right-hand troll\\nMiller has long wanted tougher measures to control migration to the U.S. In that respect, he’s in sync with Trump’s core voters—part of his value to the president. “He’s a policy adviser who has the pulse of the president’s base,” a former White House official says. “And like the president, he’s skeptical of the standard Washington playbook on trade and immigration.”\\nMiller is a curious case in that Trump often prizes aides who perform well on cable TV, whose coverage he devours. Over the past two years, Miller has had some epic appearances on the small screen. In a cool medium, he runs hot. But he’s defended Trump to the point that he’s nearly gotten himself thrown off the set. And make no mistake: For a White House aide, the defense, promotion, and celebration of Trump is a durable survival strategy.\\nIn an appearance last year on CNN (arguably Trump’s least favorite news outlet), Miller denounced “24 hours of negative anti-Trump hysterical coverage on this network.” As Miller attempted to drown out the host with stories about Trump’s virtues, Jake Tapper observed that he was really addressing an audience of one.\\nAides say that Miller is a popular figure inside the building, though, bringing in bagels for the staff. At a birthday party for Miller and a couple of other aides on the chief of staff’s patio, Trump made a surprise appearance.\\nAn undeniable asset is his speechwriting skills, past and present White House aides say.

       "'But the man who denies climate change or the harmful effects of greenhouse gases hasn’t been shy about altering his policies in response to market forces. When an opponent of Trump’s tax bill, House Republican Rick Larsen, won the 2010 election, he warned his likely opponent, Representative Jim McGovern, that he would be liable to sue the president if the proposal wasn’t signed into law. The thinking in Washington that drives the compensation system for politicians is that there are easily disputed claims in a $125-per-acre county or municipal policy, as well as in some states that more than three-quarters of an acre of land might be worth far less than what the owner actually sells for. Farmers assert they would be liable for 9 percent of the tax they collect if their field is sold for over $125,000. Nationally, only about 3 to 4 percent of sales by people on the Trump president’s tax plan will be paid by farmers. (These estimates are based on calculations by the economist Alan Krueger.)\\nBetween them, Senate Democrats and the major political parties that control both chambers of Congress, the president’s political opponents could extract a significant amount of cash from the land on which the House rule originated. Or they could demand the entire amount from the president’s estate. The downside to this arrangement is that the nature of a political party can be to suppress its candidate or legislative candidate for the presidency or vice president, which in turn may stall any legislation designed to improve the economy.\\n[As we wrote in the weeks before the speech in St. Louis last month, “If a party is big enough that its public-policy ideas are in any way unpopular, they likely can make some people pay for the party’s choice of candidate, so long as those ideas survive the election cycle without being entirely unacceptable to voters.]\\nFarmers also argue that a competitive winner and a viable candidate are both important factors in policy development, including how they are hired, where they are paid, and how they operate their farms. If they can spend as much money as they want or say they can’t do without it, farmers will spend less to produce what they will sell.\\nIn a Forbes article in 2015, economist Malcolm Gladwell made a similar argument: The most consequential goal of this economy is to minimize unemployment.\\nEven if a simple commodity such as corn isn’t economically valuable for much of the year, the supply-dependent economy of a large industry like agriculture offers greater chances for success if the farmer is a large company. If there’s a short supply of basic crops such as corn, fish, and wheat, they could produce more if the farmer purchases more. But if the farmer has a small group of highly skilled employees, and maybe some very well paid ones, he or she might not want to take on more employees just for this purpose.\\nThis dynamic goes a long way toward explaining why the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 faced trouble in multiple cities: Once a mass movement, it couldn’t be left alone unless it had a strong economy behind it. (The militant pressure from the fast-food chains and other companies that forced a change in America’s economic regulations can be traced to the same economics.) The affordability of many products in other countries might make farmers balk.\\nEven if people aren’t happy with the political system in places such as Kansas, they aren’t likely to stop thinking about the cost of politics.\\n'"

       " 'Even if a simple commodity such as corn isn’t economically valuable for much of the year, the supply-dependent economy of a large industry like agriculture offers greater chances for success if the farmer is a large company.',\n",
       " 'This dynamic goes a long way toward explaining why the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 faced trouble in multiple cities: Once a mass movement, it couldn’t be left alone unless it had a strong economy behind it.',\n",
       " '(The militant pressure from the fast-food chains and other companies that forced a change in America’s economic regulations can be traced to the same economics.)',\n",
       " 'If they can spend as much money as they want or say they can’t do without it, farmers will spend less to produce what they will sell.',\n",
