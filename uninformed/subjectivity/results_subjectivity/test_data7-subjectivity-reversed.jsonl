Farmers also argue that a competitive winner and a viable candidate are both important factors in policy development, including how they are hired, where they are paid, and how they operate their farms. But if the farmer has a small group of highly skilled employees, and maybe some very well paid ones, he or she might not want to take on more employees just for this purpose. Two-thirds of Trump\u2019s most senior aides have left or been promoted, more than every president going back to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Tenpas\u2019s research shows. Between them, Senate Democrats and the major political parties that control both chambers of Congress, the president\u2019s political opponents could extract a significant amount of cash from the land on which the House rule originated. But there are a few survivors. Nationally, only about 3 to 4 percent of sales by people on the Trump president\u2019s tax plan will be paid by farmers. Amid all the tumult, some have even flourished. The keys: praising Trump, mastering skills that he values, and forging alliances in a rivalrous West Wing. This dynamic goes a long way toward explaining why the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 faced trouble in multiple cities: Once a mass movement, it couldn\u2019t be left alone unless it had a strong economy behind it. When an opponent of Trump\u2019s tax bill, House Republican Rick Larsen, won the 2010 election, he warned his likely opponent, Representative Jim McGovern, that he would be liable to sue the president if the proposal wasn\u2019t signed into law. (The militant pressure from the fast-food chains and other companies that forced a change in America\u2019s economic regulations can be traced to the same economics.) If none of that works, plant yourself in front of a TV camera and impress the boss. Consider Stephen Miller, the 33-year-old who started during the campaign. Miller\u2019s portfolio is expanding. In recent weeks, Trump has given him a lead role on Miller\u2019s pet issue\u2014immigration policy. Trump told him: \u201cWhatever you need, you\u2019re empowered in this space; get it done,\u201d a White House aide says. Read: Trump\u2019s right-hand troll\nMiller has long wanted tougher measures to control migration to the U.S. In that respect, he\u2019s in sync with Trump\u2019s core voters\u2014part of his value to the president. \u201cHe\u2019s a policy adviser who has the pulse of the president\u2019s base,\u201d a former White House official says. [As we wrote in the weeks before the speech in St. Louis last month, \u201cIf a party is big enough that its public-policy ideas are in any way unpopular, they likely can make some people pay for the party\u2019s choice of candidate, so long as those ideas survive the election cycle without being entirely unacceptable to voters.] \u201cAnd like the president, he\u2019s skeptical of the standard Washington playbook on trade and immigration.\u201d\nMiller is a curious case in that Trump often prizes aides who perform well on cable TV, whose coverage he devours. But the man who denies climate change or the harmful effects of greenhouse gases hasn\u2019t been shy about altering his policies in response to market forces. Over the past two years, Miller has had some epic appearances on the small screen. (These estimates are based on calculations by the economist Alan Krueger.) In a cool medium, he runs hot. But he\u2019s defended Trump to the point that he\u2019s nearly gotten himself thrown off the set. The downside to this arrangement is that the nature of a political party can be to suppress its candidate or legislative candidate for the presidency or vice president, which in turn may stall any legislation designed to improve the economy. Farmers assert they would be liable for 9 percent of the tax they collect if their field is sold for over $125,000. And make no mistake: For a White House aide, the defense, promotion, and celebration of Trump is a durable survival strategy. In an appearance last year on CNN (arguably Trump\u2019s least favorite news outlet), Miller denounced \u201c24 hours of negative anti-Trump hysterical coverage on this network.\u201d As Miller attempted to drown out the host with stories about Trump\u2019s virtues, Jake Tapper observed that he was really addressing an audience of one. Aides say that Miller is a popular figure inside the building, though, bringing in bagels for the staff. At a birthday party for Miller and a couple of other aides on the chief of staff\u2019s patio, Trump made a surprise appearance. An undeniable asset is his speechwriting skills, past and present White House aides say. He has a feel for Trump\u2019s voice\u2014a skill that Trump believes \u201che can\u2019t live without,\u201d one former aide says. Miller has also been nimble when it comes to internal White House politics. Even if people aren\u2019t happy with the political system in places such as Kansas, they aren\u2019t likely to stop thinking about the cost of politics. Even if a simple commodity such as corn isn\u2019t economically valuable for much of the year, the supply-dependent economy of a large industry like agriculture offers greater chances for success if the farmer is a large company. He was first thought to be an acolyte of the former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. If there\u2019s a short supply of basic crops such as corn, fish, and wheat, they could produce more if the farmer purchases more. Both touted economic nationalism, putting them at odds with a globalist faction led by the former economic adviser Gary Cohn and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But Miller made certain not to alienate the globalists nor to make Bannon\u2019s mistake of antagonizing Trump\u2019s family. Or they could demand the entire amount from the president\u2019s estate. If they can spend as much money as they want or say they can\u2019t do without it, farmers will spend less to produce what they will sell. In a Forbes article in 2015, economist Malcolm Gladwell made a similar argument: The most consequential goal of this economy is to minimize unemployment. The affordability of many products in other countries might make farmers balk. The thinking in Washington that drives the compensation system for politicians is that there are easily disputed claims in a $125-per-acre county or municipal policy, as well as in some states that more than three-quarters of an acre of land might be worth far less than what the owner actually sells for.", "summary": "Amid West Wing turnover that is \u201coff the charts,\u201d the survivors have mastered the art of praising the boss.", "authors": "Peter Nicholas", "publish_date": "04-14-2019", "domain": "theatlantic.com", "warc_date": "20190415131634", "status": "success_wayback", "split": "test", "label": "human", "inst_index": 9201}
