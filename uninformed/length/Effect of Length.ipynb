       " 'title': 'Malware researcher Marcus Hutchins pleads guilty, ending his legal case – TechCrunch',\n",
       " 'text': 'Malware researcher Marcus Hutchins has pleaded guilty to two counts of creating and selling a powerful banking malware, ending a long and protracted battle with U.S. prosecutors.\\nHutchins, a British national who goes by the online handle MalwareTech, was arrested in August 2017 as he was due to fly back to the U.K. following the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas. Prosecutors charged Hutchins with his involvement with creating the Kronos banking malware, dating back to 2014. He was later freed on bail.\\nA plea agreement was filed with the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where the case was being heard on Friday. His trial was set to begin later this year.\\nHutchins agreed to plead guilty to distributing Kronos, a trojan that can be used to steal passwords and credentials from banking websites. In recent years, the trojan has continued to spread. He also agreed to plead guilty to a second count of conspiracy.\\nHutchins faces up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors have dropped the remaining charges.\\nIn a brief statement on his website, Hutchins said: “I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.”\\n“Having grown up, I’ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes,” he said. “I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks.”\\nHis attorney Marcia Hofmann did not immediately return a request for comment.\\nHutchins rose to prominence after he stopped the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, months before his arrest. The attack used powerful hacking tools developed by the National Security Agency, which were later leaked, to backdoor thousands of Windows computers and install ransomware. The attack was later attributed to hackers backed by North Korea, knocking U.K. hospitals offline and crippling major companies around the world.\\nBy registering a domain name found in the malware’s code, Hutchins stemmed the spread of the infection. He was hailed a hero for stopping the attack.\\nPrior to his release and after, Hutchins gained further praise and respect from the security community for his contributions to the malware-reversing field, and demonstrating his findings so others can learn from his findings.\\nJustice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas declined to comment.\\n',\n",

       " 'gens_article': ['Malware researcher Marcus Hutchins, who has been battling the FDA over his right to share top-level security information, has pleaded guilty to a charge related to software designed to spread malware.\\nHutchins will spend two years and six months in prison for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, US Attorney Jeffery Castro announced.\\nAs part of the plea deal, the nature of the malware found on Hutchins’ computer has been redacted. To get around what is known as Hutchins’ A.I. defense, Google is allowing the Department of Justice to redact the information.\\nAn offer he initially made to the FDA then backed out of, according to Assistant US Attorney Micheal Furnall, was essentially a $75,000 fine and a one-year jail sentence on a serious bias crime charge, Furnall said. If Hutchins had failed to comply with the deal, he’d face 30 years in prison, and he was sentenced to five years of supervised release, Furnall said.\\n“In all of these federal cases the defendant agreed to abide by the consequences of his actions,” Furnall told a federal judge in Washington, DC. “And every act has consequences.”\\nHutchins’ case first made headlines when the Xandoor malware campaign was disclosed in January 2017. By December of that year, China and other countries had mounted a campaign of cyberattacks across the globe, and Hutchins’ company, Immunity, was threatened with FTC action. For nearly a year, Hutchins and scientists from the FBI and security group Trend Micro tried to get the FBI to open a case against Hutchins, to ensure that he would never again have access to the United States’ national security information.\\nLast week, the company’s CEO, Christophe Sarloop, said in an email that its results “do not reflect this disruption.”\\nHutchins, who is based in the US but has been living in China since 2015, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\\nIt was not the first time Hutchins, formerly known as Nicholas Hampton, has faced charges in the United States. In a case related to the APT1 Trojan, Hutchins reportedly obtained all kinds of antivirus and security information and distributed the malware with other people’s signatures. He shared his top-level information with then-FBI national security advisor Tom Bossert and others. The case prompted the SEC to issue a notice last year that Hutchins has a fiduciary duty to shareholders.\\nWhen the SEC took up the matter, representatives from the antivirus industry urged the SEC to halt the probe.\\nAt the same time, Hutchins said he planned to donate most of his money to charity. In January 2018, the SEC sued Hutchins for defrauding investors and causing them to lose more than $72 million, including about $30 million to TechCrunch.\\nIn August 2017, the FTC announced an agreement to create a criminal investigation of Hutchins in exchange for the removal of Hutchins’ encryption keys. The FTC also asked the court to seal Hutchins’ computer records and his communications with others. The deal put into motion an investigation which continued despite the agreement.\\nAfter the FTC found the successful counteroffer by the United States government, the fraud case was settled.\\nThe FBI declined to comment.\\n'],\n",

       "'Malware researcher Marcus Hutchins, who has been battling the FDA over his right to share top-level security information, has pleaded guilty to a charge related to software designed to spread malware.\\nHutchins will spend two years and six months in prison for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, US Attorney Jeffery Castro announced.\\nAs part of the plea deal, the nature of the malware found on Hutchins’ computer has been redacted. To get around what is known as Hutchins’ A.I. defense, Google is allowing the Department of Justice to redact the information.\\nAn offer he initially made to the FDA then backed out of, according to Assistant US Attorney Micheal Furnall, was essentially a $75,000 fine and a one-year jail sentence on a serious bias crime charge, Furnall said. If Hutchins had failed to comply with the deal, he’d face 30 years in prison, and he was sentenced to five years of supervised release, Furnall said.\\n“In all of these federal cases the defendant agreed to abide by the consequences of his actions,” Furnall told a federal judge in Washington, DC. “And every act has consequences.”\\nHutchins’ case first made headlines when the Xandoor malware campaign was disclosed in January 2017. By December of that year, China and other countries had mounted a campaign of cyberattacks across the globe, and Hutchins’ company, Immunity, was threatened with FTC action. For nearly a year, Hutchins and scientists from the FBI and security group Trend Micro tried to get the FBI to open a case against Hutchins, to ensure that he would never again have access to the United States’ national security information.\\nLast week, the company’s CEO, Christophe Sarloop, said in an email that its results “do not reflect this disruption.”\\nHutchins, who is based in the US but has been living in China since 2015, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\\nIt was not the first time Hutchins, formerly known as Nicholas Hampton, has faced charges in the United States. In a case related to the APT1 Trojan, Hutchins reportedly obtained all kinds of antivirus and security information and distributed the malware with other people’s signatures. He shared his top-level information with then-FBI national security advisor Tom Bossert and others. The case prompted the SEC to issue a notice last year that Hutchins has a fiduciary duty to shareholders.\\nWhen the SEC took up the matter, representatives from the antivirus industry urged the SEC to halt the probe.\\nAt the same time, Hutchins said he planned to donate most of his money to charity. In January 2018, the SEC sued Hutchins for defrauding investors and causing them to lose more than $72 million, including about $30 million to TechCrunch.\\nIn August 2017, the FTC announced an agreement to create a criminal investigation of Hutchins in exchange for the removal of Hutchins’ encryption keys. The FTC also asked the court to seal Hutchins’ computer records and his communications with others. The deal put into motion an investigation which continued despite the agreement.\\nAfter the FTC found the successful counteroffer by the United States government, the fraud case was settled.\\nThe FBI declined to comment.\\n'"
