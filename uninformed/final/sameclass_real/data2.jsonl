Their return home will coincide with a family get-together at their house. In attendance will be my 20-something niece and her boyfriend \u2014 whose behavior needs improvement. He\u2019s a nice guy otherwise, but he is evidently unaware of how to carry himself thoughtfully. At my parents\u2019 60th wedding anniversary party, for example, he and my niece occupied the only prime space, directly across from my parents, using my parents as a backdrop for their make-out session. I would have preferred those two seats be occupied by my brother and me, so we could be physically close to my parents during this celebration of their marriage. At Christmas at my parents\u2019 house, my niece\u2019s boyfriend occupied/reserved the front of the buffet line while everyone else helped to prepare it. He stood there (literally) wiping his dripping nose with his fingers and then transferring those drippings to the serving utensil he picked up immediately afterward. I\u2019m afraid if I say anything (praise in public, coach in private) my youngest brother will hear, go ballistic and temporarily avoid family functions, which would devastate my 80-year-old mother. Can anything be done? \u2014 Upset Uncle\nDear Uncle: It is the aunt/uncle\u2019s time-honored prerogative to offer gentle suggestions to clueless young-adult nieces/nephews. This is not parenting. This is uncle-ing. And so, if the couple is sitting where you believe you and your brother should be sitting, you say, \u201cHi guys, would you mind moving over two chairs so my brother and I can sit next to our parents?\u201d\nREAD MORE: You're ready for your adult child and his kid to move out. How do you handle? \u00bb\nIn terms of the buffet hoarding (a pet peeve of mine), in our large family we have dealt with this by one or more elders leading a blessing before the serving, acknowledging and publicly thanking the people who prepared the food, and then stating: \u201cLet\u2019s let the older people go through the line first, so they can get themselves situated. Then the rest of us can go through.\u201d\nI can\u2019t speak to your younger brother\u2019s choice to go ballistic. You are not offering judgments here; you are merely demonstrating some leadership. Dear Amy: The best grocery in my town has great made-to-order sandwiches at an excellent price. I have been effusive in my praise and thanks to the woman at the counter who is always there in the early morning when I typically place my order. Over time, the attitude of the person making the sandwiches has changed visibly, where it is clear that she is unhappy to see me and to make the sandwich. Once I realized that my order interrupts her morning prep work, I have now minimized those requests. On several occasions, I\u2019ve even apologized to her for placing the order. But recently I ordered a sandwich later in the day and got the same unfriendly response. And now I have begun to wonder whether this is her problem, or mine. There is no restriction posted on when a sandwich can be ordered. So what do I do? Say something to her? Say something to the manager? Stop ordering a sandwich that is healthy and tasty because it makes the employee unhappy? I don\u2019t want to do anything to hurt this person at her job, as I see she works very hard and I am sympathetic to her. But there is something upside down about this and I don\u2019t know what to do. \u2014 Sandwich Guy\nDear Sandwich Guy: This is not your problem. So far, the only problem I see is that you are apologizing for patronizing a local business, and cheerfully and respectfully asking someone to do her job.

If you are courteous (it sounds as if you are), then the person working there should respond in kind. I wonder if you have seen her comportment toward other customers. Is she grouchy toward everyone? Have you also seen the legendary \u201cSoup Nazi\u201d episode of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d? Viewing this might help put this episode into perspective. Likely her demeanor has nothing to do with you.
