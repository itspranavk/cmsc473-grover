       "{'title': 'Brexit: Corbyn told to back new EU referendum or lose millions of supporters',\n",
       " 'text': 'Jeremy Corbyn has been warned by Labour’s leader in the European parliament and other grandees that the party will be deserted by millions of anti-Brexit voters if it fails to clearly back a second referendum in its manifesto for next month’s EU elections.\\nThe message from Richard Corbett, who leads Labour’s 20 MEPs, comes amid growing fears at the top of the party that it could lose a generation of young, pro-EU voters if it does not guarantee another public vote.\\nThat age group, as well as many other Remainers, MPs say, could turn instead to unambiguously anti-Brexit parties, including the fledgling independent group Change UK, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the SNP.\\nCorbett said: “If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message. If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well.”\\nRichard Corbett, leader of Labour’s 20 representatives in the European parliament.

This has prompted speculation that there may be no commitment to one in Labour’s European election manifesto.\\nShould Labour support a second Brexit referendum? | Jess Phillips and Gloria de Piero Read more\\nFormer Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett also called for the manifesto to back a second public vote, saying: “It is very important that there is a clear message about where Labour stands and what Labour is offering. In my view that clear and simple message should be that there should be a confirmatory vote of the British people.\\n“There is a great opportunity for Labour if we are clear. But lack of clarity would cost us support not only in these elections but it will feed through into the next general election and that may not be far away.”\\nThe issue of whether Labour commits to another referendum in its European manifesto, or fudges the issue to avoid alienating its Leave-supporting voters, is already renewing tensions at the top of the party. Those in the shadow cabinet who believe the manifesto should have a second referendum pledge at its heart fear they will be cut out of discussions and that the content and wording will be decided by Corbyn’s office and the national executive committee (NEC), which is dominated by Corbyn supporters. On Saturday night a senior party source said responsibility for what would be in the manifesto would be “an NEC decision in consultation with stakeholders”. Second referendum supporters in the shadow cabinet – Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson – are likely to insist, however, that it is also fully involved.\\n“It would be beyond unacceptable if the shadow cabinet is not able to approve the document and it is all done by the NEC and leader’s office,” said another shadow cabinet member. Opponents of another referendum in the shadow cabinet, including party chairman Ian Lavery, warn that Labour will lose support among its Leave voters if it backs a second vote.\\nAn Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that just 17% of people who say they are certain to vote in the European elections would choose the Tories, against 29% who would back Labour. Some 26% say they would back pro-Remain parties – the Liberal Democrats (10%), the SNP (6%) the Greens (6%) and Change UK (4%) – while 25% would back either Ukip (13%) or Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party (12%). Although it is now almost three years since the June 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, European leaders last week insisted Britain would have to take part in European elections at the end of next month as a condition for extending membership until 31 October, unless a Brexit deal passed through parliament before 22 May.\\nLabour insiders say all but four of the party’s current MEPs, who all back another referendum, want to stand again and will in all probability be confirmed as candidates this week.\\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson thinks Corbyn should follow the example set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Photograph: Getty Images\\nOne senior party figure said: “The result of this is that even if our manifesto does not confirm a second referendum, that is what our candidates will be advocating on the doorsteps.”\\nAt the last European elections in 2014 – in which Ukip won the most seats – responsibility for writing Labour’s European election manifesto was delegated to a sub-group of the national policy forum. But this time, given the hugely increased profile of the elections, there are demands for the process to widened.\\nWatson said Labour had to tread carefully and suggested the party follow the lead of Harold Wilson, who in 1975 allowed MPs and his cabinet to vote according to their consciences in the referendum confirming UK membership of the European Community.\\nHe said: “A Labour government would be duty bound to deliver the result of a confirmatory referendum, whatever that may be. The public must trust us to honour that result so it makes sense for our party leadership to take a careful position and our MPs to be allowed to campaign with their consciences. Wilson’s example is a good one. He kept the government and country together.”\\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has warned that another referendum would damage trust in democracy, said the focus should be to reach a cross-party agreement. He said: “Most Labour colleagues are very encouraged by media reports – and by the prime minister’s recent comments about a customs union – that we may be within touching distance of an exit deal that protects jobs, environmental standards and workers’ rights.\\n“If this is indeed the case, then it’s vital that we do not allow the negotiations to be torpedoed by insisting on a public vote. It is just not realistic to hope the prime minister would ever whip her MPs to back a second referendum. The first task should be to get a ‘Labour-shaped’ deal agreed and embedded in the withdrawal agreement so it was not able to be ripped up by future Tory leader.\\n“There will then of course be ample opportunity for colleagues to press their case for a second referendum on the basis of this renegotiated deal by attaching an amendment to the legislation needed to implement Brexit.”\\n',\n",

       " 'gens_article': ['Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to back a hard Brexit even if it means losing millions of his own supporters, following pressure from his own campaign in the EU referendum.\\nAn analysis of online sentiment by Bridge has found that 62% of Labour activists opposed a hard Brexit while 50% believed it would result in leaving the European Union.\\nOn Friday, 63% of Labour supporters asked if they would back a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit were it to happen, compared with 18% who said they would definitely not back a hard Brexit and 4% who said they would.\\nAnnual surveys published by Vote Leave over the past six months have found that none of the UK’s 86 or so political parties had a manifesto commitment to a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit.\\nA new, joint report by the Sunday Times and Britain First to be released on Monday will reveal that nearly all the party’s activists want a “hard Brexit”.\\nBoth parties have complained that pro-hard-Brexit “Britishness” was portrayed in the campaign, but the analysis by Bridge shows that 59% of all local parties’ online profiles from 2015 to 2017 want to see Britain remain in the European Union.\\nJonathan Khalil, the report’s co-author, said: “The outcome of the EU referendum clearly exposed a people’s desire for Britain to leave the European Union but with a choice, union or departure.\\n“We need to argue for an alternative to the Conservative government’s Brexit package based on free trade, market access and indeed freedom from Brussels. Instead we have a Conservative government which has removed the Chequers agreement and is planning to offer up the precise opposite – instead of full membership of the European Union, we will be blocked from free trade, customs union and single market.”\\nThe analysis found that 35% of the Conservative and 22% of Labour volunteers had a raft of pro-Brexit promises, from a strong trade relationship with the EU to an alternative to the government’s Brexit deal.\\nThe research, the only analysis published by Bridge before the research came out, will almost certainly fuel Labour protests against the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and other ministers accusing them of fighting for a hard Brexit because they have nothing else to run on.\\n“It is interesting to note that, whilst some people’s stated concerns are eurosceptic, many people’s concerns are that while we are ending the European Union, we are not leaving the UK,” Khalil said.\\n“Interestingly, the public discussion on membership of the European Union focuses on the European Union in its totality. The idea that when your country is leaving it is going to be fine, well that is not how people really feel about the European Union.”\\nBridge, run by the London thinktank the London Group, said the figures reflected people’s shared perspective that Britain would likely be better off outside the EU than inside it.\\nKhalil said that 23% of Labour online profiles chose a hard Brexit while 15% chose a soft Brexit and just 3% responded clearly. Some 62% of the people who responded strongly said they would definitely vote to leave the EU and 16% would definitely not.\\nKhalil said that there was no evidence of a great public divide on Europe in the Labour party, but that the party could challenge what people mean when they say the EU. “The public can say we want to be outside the EU, in other words, we don’t want the European Union. But is it an option? You know, why is it being described as an option?”\\nStarmer, the shadow foreign secretary, told the Guardian: “If you tell people they can’t say ‘no’ when they say Brexit, then they are going to walk away. People are saying ‘no’ because they don’t want to be on the ‘no’ side of a decision.”\\nA Vote Leave spokesman said: “The anti-EU far-right is determined to make a mockery of the referendum and won’t stop when it comes to trying to block Brexit. It would be utterly irrational and irresponsible of anyone to effectively pretend there’s a huge vote of people against Brexit.\\n“We know that Labour members are overwhelmingly anti-EU and most believe Brexit could have brought benefits to Britain’s economy – and this is not an attempt to undermine the referendum.”\\n• This article was amended on Monday 13 April 2019 because it had mistakenly referred to Labour’s online profiles from 2015 to 2017, rather than 2015 and 2016.

       "\"What a magical, inspiring time for right-wing thought. On Friday morning, Fox & Friends welcomed “social media superstars and Fox Nation contributors” Diamond and Silk to discuss climate change and immigration, and if you’d rather just skip ahead to the part where you bang your head against your desk, I won’t blame you.\\nIn case you don’t feel like losing five minutes of your one precious life to something that will make you noticeably more stupid, here’s the gist: Diamond and Silk got airtime on a national cable news network to make the claim that climate change is real, but it is to be expected because our planet is rotating very quickly, every single day of the year.\\nThe climate is indeed changing, but, according to Diamond and Silk, it’s not due to the pollution we’re spewing into the sky. It’s not carbon or methane. It is, I guess, friction, and the purpose of the Green New Deal is to literally stop the Earth from turning, and reset it. This is a thing that was said on television this very morning, and your Dad watched it, and so did the president of the United States, and all of them echoed Silk’s assessment: “Mm-hmm.”\\nThe hosts then turned their attention to Beto O’Rourke, who at a recent campaign event called President Trump out for painting Mexicans as “rapists” and asylum seekers as “animals.” Asked to respond to O’Rourke, Diamond said this, and I am not kidding: “When I listen to Beto O’Rourke, his rhetoric, it reminds me of a slave owner. Anytime you want to tear down existing walls, and allow poor people to flow into our country, and have them living in the shadows, working for slave wages, that makes you a slave owner.”\\nIf you were wondering whether they mentioned our president, who continues to benefit from cheap, undocumented labor at his hotels and golf clubs, just kidding, you weren’t wondering that. “Beto O’Rourke need to look at himself,” said Diamond. “And his own rhetoric,” Silk chimed in. “Right. Is what he need to do,” Diamond concluded, over a chyron promising even more of this on Fox Nation, for just $5.99 a month.\\nFox News—really, cable news in general—is not the place for deep and nuanced thought, but “climate change is because the Earth is speeding” and “immigration reform is slavery” are both alarmingly stupid ideas. And once again, there is a one-hundred percent chance the president is watching and nodding along.\\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic presidential hopeful who was recently attacked by a conservative blog for suggesting Jesus would be cool with bestiality. Buttigieg, who's known as Mayor Pete, did not suggest this. The Washington Post Getty Images\\nAll of this comes one day after cable-news pundit and, I don’t know, viking cosplayer Erick Erickson published a post on his blog The Resurgent about rising Democratic Presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mayor Pete is an observant Christian who supports a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, and he recently called out the religious right for “saying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.” Pretty much every other Democratic Presidential hopeful holds this view; all are pro-choice, nearly all claim to be Christian. So it is interesting that only the first-ever openly gay one gets to be the subject of this headline:\\nMayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Bestiality.\\nThe claim itself is too ignorant to put any energy into rebutting, but it does bear pointing out to my right-wing gay grifters out there: this is what they think of you. Whether you try to fit into their definition of respectable or not, even if you go on Tucker Carlson and eat a Chick-Fil-A sandwich, when push comes to shove, you’re no better than a goat-fucker.\\nIs everything getting dumber, or are we just dizzy because the world is spinning so fast?\\n\""

       "'Earlier this week, Eric Bolling and Tucker Carlson broadcast a very heated segment on climate change on Fox News. They started with arguing over the planet\\'s total energy consumption and shifted it over to the question of how long we\\'ve been warming and to the current tension over climate change. Given the dire warnings by governments around the world, the segment, which was hosted by Bret Baier, drew boos from the Fox audience.\\nEarly in the segment, Carlson suggested climate change was not natural, and that it was \"really building up steam.\" In fact, there\\'s a pretty wide consensus on the fact that climate change is what happens when the Earth\\'s climate gets too hot or too cold, and this is largely in large part a result of our over-all population growth. [Note to Fox News: Please, please, please not make human births more likely as a result of one spike in population.] While some tech-savvy folks in the audience had tried to amplify Carlson\\'s calls, others booed him at every possible second before he spoke. One woman talked about how her child used to ask if she should go to bed. As one viewer commented, the feedback from these moderators can make him or her feel as if they have to change the subject, something that has happened to Nielsen ratings. In this environment, Eric Bolling should be applauded for trying to highlight Fox News\\' hostility toward him.\\nMore recently, a segment on Fox News\\' Townhall website showed a man wearing a \"Jihad\" button and asking questions about Islam. And most recently, Bret Baier\\'s show featured an alleged suspect in the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting, noting that her Twitter account \"has a large number of followers and a lot of followers.\" Baier then pointed out that a website was used to post the tweets about her, and at the time of her show, her Twitter feed contained the same tweet. He went on to mention, though, that that\\'s \"biohazard [a term used in the ISIS propaganda].”\\nThese conversations are entertaining in their own way and there will be times when the discussion between viewers and hosts can get heated. But these shouldn\\'t be representative of public discussion of climate change. Doubtless the comments from some on Fox News will not be representative of public discourse on the topic. But they should not be the focus of discussion at all. There is not enough information out there about climate change to make the calculations for ourselves. We shouldn\\'t be forced to rely on our instinct to know when something is climate friendly or climate negligent.\\n'"
