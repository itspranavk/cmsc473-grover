# Toolbox

## Extracting Articles

Using `extract_article.py`, existing `.jsonl` data files generated by Zeller's team using their web crawler can be converted to a Grover-friendly format.

## Graphing

Using `graphing.py`, probabilities generated by Grover under `test-probs.npy` can be plotted. We use this script to generate all plots in our project.

## Load Numpy Files

Using `load_npy.py`, probabilities generated by Grover under `test-probs.npy` can be printed for easy access. Otherwise, this requires manually importing `numpy` to load and view the probabilities.

## Read Checkpoint

Using `read_checkpoint.py`, model variables i.e layers can be printed. A sample output is available [here](../tf2_grover/adversarial/var_name.txt).
